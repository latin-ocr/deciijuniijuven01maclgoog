10⁰ D. J UNII JUVENALIS

Laternam: illud enim vestris datur alveolis quod

Canna Micipsarum prora subvexit 001110,

Propter qnod Rornae cnm Bocchare nemo lavatur, 90
Quod tutos etiam facita serpentibus Afros.

Mullus erit domini, quem misit Corsica vel quern
Tauromenitanae rupes, qnando omne peractum est

Et jam defecit nostrum mare, dum gula saevit

Retibns assiduis penitus scrutante macello 95
Proxima, nec patitur Tyrrhenum erescere piscem.

Instruit ergo focum provincia 3 sumitur illinc

Quod captator emat laenas, Aurelia vendat.
