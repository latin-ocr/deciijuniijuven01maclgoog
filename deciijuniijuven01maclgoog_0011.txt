vi- PREFACE.

asserticn, and in many cases I have preferred the readings of other
MSS„ of which Ruperti has given a catalogue and description. Ι
myself am in possession of one which is not in Ruperti’s list. Itis
neatly written on parchment in 8vo. form, but is incompleta and of ’
no particular value, being an Italian MS. of the early part perhaps

of the fifteenth century. As it is not a transcriptos any MS.
referred to by other editors, I have occasionally noticed it, and ·
have called it M. Many of its readings in disputed passages Ι

have rejected.

Ι have not followed implicitly the judgment of any editor. Jahn
and Hermann rely too much Ι think on the MS. they do well to
prefer. Hermann keeps more closely to it than Jahn, sometimesI
think with good reason. They have not published commentarios.
'Phe notes to which 1 attach mest value are those of Heinrich,
published by himself without the text in 1806, 1810, and repub-'
lished by his son two years after his death (Bonn, 1839), with a
text corrected in accordanoe with his fathcffs commentary. Tbese
notes did not satisly the judgment of Madvig, who thought them
baneath the reputation and abilities cf their author. To me they
appear throughout manly and sensible, free from pedantry (the
plague ol commentaries), and worthy of the great writer whom it
is their only object to explain. As there is no ancient author that
requires masculine sense te understand and explain his meaning so
'much as Juvenal, so I know ,of uo commentatores any author that
surpasses Heinrich in that quality. His notes are in German, and
Ι suppose this isthe reason why Ruperti’s edition continues to be
much used by studente in this country. It is the work of an
industrious man of weak mind, always liable to waver when his
judgment happens to be right, but never to be relied upon in cases

· ol difficulty. Nor is he strictly honest, fer he changed his interpre-
auonsin some incanae in his reseruassemus aanowreegug
that he was indehted to Heinrich for his second thoughts. A
smart and rather sarcastic review of Ruperti’s notes was put forth
by Heineclra (Halle, 1804), and is sometimes referred to in the
notes ef this edition. Heiuecke is olten wrong himself. , He was
young when he wrote. The Parisian editor, Achaintre (1810), has
