SATIRA VI.

Nullum crimen abest facinusque libidinis ex quo
Paupertas Romana perit: hinc fluxit ad istos 29⁵
Et Sybaris colles, hinc et Rhodos et Miletos
Atque coronatum et petulans madidumque Tarentum.
Prima peregrinos obscena pecunia mores
Intulit, et turpi fregerunt secula luxu

Grandia quae mediis jam noctibus ostrea mordet,
Quum perfusa mero spumant unguenta Telemo,

’ Quum bibitur concha, quum jam vertigine tectum
Ambulat ct geminis exsurgit mensa lucernis. ³05
