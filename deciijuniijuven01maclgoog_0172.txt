SATIRA VI.

Et cellam vacuam atque suem. Tunc nude papillis

Constitit auratis titulum mentita Lyciscae,

Ostenditque tuum, generose Britannice, ventrem.

Excepit blande intrantes etque uere poposcit, 125

Et resupino jacens multorum absorbuit ictus.

Mox lenone suas jum dimittente puellus

Tristis abit, et quod potuit temen ultima cellam

Clausit adhuc ardens rigidae tentigine vulvae,

Et lassata viris nec dum satiata recessit,

Obscurisque genis turpis fumoque lucernae

Foedu lupanaris tulit ad pulvinar odorem.
