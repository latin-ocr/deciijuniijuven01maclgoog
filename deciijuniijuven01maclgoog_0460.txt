Seriolae veterem metuens deradere limum
Ingemit, ‘Hoc bene sit l’ tunicatum cum sale mordens ³0
Caepe et, farratam pueris plaudentibus ollam,
Pannosam faecem morientis sorbet aceti ?'’
At si unctus cesses et figas in cute solem,
Est prope te ignotus cubito qui tangat, et acre
“ Despuat in mores, penemque arcanaque lumbi 35
Runcaritem populo marcentes pandere vulvas:
“ 'Pu cum maxillis balanatum gausape pectas,
Inguinibus quare detonsus gurgulio extat?
Quinque palaestritae licet haec plantaria vellant,
Elixasque nates labefactent forcipe adunca, so
Non tamen ista filix ullo mansuescit aratro.'’
