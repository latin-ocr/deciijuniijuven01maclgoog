INTRODUCTION.

Penelus’ lest entire, like Juvenel’s, is ι fragment. Thnt he wrote slpwly, sethe
Grnmmsrisu seys, msy be easily believed, end his early denth ιιι] heve overtaken him
before he hed time ιο finish this poem. This would give itan interest which in itself
it hue not.

The poet hes retired for the winter to the coest, sud ιι living οιι the shores of the
Gulf of Spezie (Lunae portus), where, if the Soholisst ιι ιο be believed, bie mother
lived ester her second merriuge. He sits down to write ιο his friend Caesius Bsseue,
the lyric poet; und ulter peyiug ι high compliment to his genius, he commende the
climate eud eceuery eud retirement of the pisce he is steping ιι. There he lives free
from ιιι euriety end ιιι jeelousy of his neighbours' prosperity. He contreets ιιιι own
stete of mind with ιιιιι of meu, οιι the one hund, who deuy themselves the necessaries
of life, end, on the other, ιιιιο run through their estete in their youth with ιιοιοιιι
living. He expresses his resolution to enjoy what he hes got, end edvises ιιι men ιο
desi libemlly with their menne, living up to their income, end being resdy ιο help
ι friend in time of need, even et the secriflce of pert of their estete. This suggestion
brings up the priucipel subject of the entire, which ιι the *fully of those who deny
themselves for the sulse of their heire, ι fsvourite subject with Horace. Whether it
ιιιι the poet’e intention to continue thet subject to the end of the entire, οι ιο put iu
eny other point of view the spirit of money-getting, it is impossible ιο esp. But
lem surprised thet Csseubon, John, end othere should treet tho entire ιι ιιι entire
composition. lt ιι menifestly uulinished, end so the (ιιιιιιιιιιιιιιιί memoir ex·
presel etates.

Of y(issesius Bessus not much ιι known. He wass lyric poet, sud Persius, with the
pertielity of ι friend, speslrs highly ofhis poems. But Quintilian hed no greet opinion
