must examine carefully. I think that many of Ribbeck’s criticisms
on particular passages may be answered, ⁴but it seems to me impossible
to read the work of the s0·called Declamator without feeling the great
difference between him and the writer of the ten undisputed Satires.
Whether that difference is best explained by assuming that we have
two writers under one name, or on some other hypothesis, is a matter
which every reader must determine sor himself.

The peculiar difficulty os Persius consiste in the arrangement of the
dialogus or supposed dialogus. There are also a few passages which
perhaps no editor has yet satisfactorily explained. I think Mr. Maeleane
has handled the matter well, though he may be mistalren sometimes.
I agree with what he says of Jahn's copious commentary. Jahn’s
edition is a most laborious and useful work, and his commentary is full
of learning. But the good sense is not equal to the learning, and heis
sometimes completely wrong in his explanation. I prefer Heinrich’s
briefer and less learned notes.
