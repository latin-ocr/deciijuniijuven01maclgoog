SATIRA ΙΙ. 23

Tho most corrupt ruay therefore well despisc these moraliete, aud turn the tables on
them, as hauronia did when eho heard one cry for the Julian law: “O happy times
(cried she) with such a brrlwark for its morale! Lot the town blnsh, another Cato is
come down from heaven! But whence, pray, thie perfumoryf If you must call old
lawe up from their rest, you’d better sammon the Scantiniau first. Look at the men,
for they aro worse than we, bnt their compact army and numbers eave them ; tho
lcwd will hang together: among usnought so detestable iefonnd. Say,do we meddlc
with the forum and the lawe? A few, and but a few, are seen in the arena. But you
will sit and spin and do onr women'e work better, yea than the best of ue. We all
know who was Hister’s heir, sud hy what complaisance his wife got rich ς andothers
may do likcwise. And yet we are condemned; and censure speres the raven to hunt
‘down the dove.’' These Stoice lled confused before the truth of her rebukc.

V. 65. What will not others do when you put ou those clothes of gaure and go and
preach before admiring crowde against the female sinuers, Creticus? They would ιιι
least put on ιι decent toga if it came to that. = ‘⁴ But it ie so hot,” say yon: why then
go uaked; maduere is less disgraccful. Looh st the dress in which, had you lived
then, our hardy ancoetors had seen yon in the rostra. Would yon not cry ont,
“ Heaven and carth !'' if yon saw a judex eo attired? How would a witness look in

clothes like these? And yet you, stern unbending Stolo, go tmueparentl
V. 78. The infection has spread, aud will further spread, like murrain among sheep. or
sourf in pige, or contagione mt from grape to grape. Yon will go ou ιο something

worsethan this. The height of wickednese is reached hy slow degreee. Soon wa
shall see yon among those who mock the litos of Bona Dea, driving out the women,
and keeping up euch orgiee as the Baptae tire Cotytto with. They wear long gerlande
on their heade 'and jewels on their neck, aud sacrifice, and pour libatione. Here ono
paints his eyebrows aud makes his eyes look languishing: another drinke from au
obscene glaee with his long locke tied up in a net of gold, with a handeomo tnaie,
while his slave swears by hie master'e Juno! Another holds a mirror ιο his face euch
as vile Otho carried when he went to the ware 3 anovel picce of fur-uitare for a camp!
Of course it ie a great mau's part to kill a tyrant-and ιο mind hie skin5 ιο οἰιιι at
empireo-and to smooth his face. Semiramis and Cleopatra did not so. Here is no
reverence for the table, none ; hut Cybele’e foul liceuce and the languishing voice, a
⁸ fanatic high priest with his white hair, rare gluttou he and master of his art. Long
since they should have eut their useless parts, ae tho Phrygian priests are wont.

V. 117. Gracchus hie portion brought ιο a trampeter: the marriage dcede were aigued ς
the bleesing spoken ; thc feast prepared ς the new bride lay upon his husbaud’e bosom.
Ye nobles! need we the censor or the haruspex here? What if a woman celred ora
cow lambed f yon’d shndder more and count them greater munstero. The priest of
Mars who sweated with the ancilia pute on abridal dress! Gradivus, whence this

wcalth marries a man, and yet thy wmth ie still! quit thenthc plain which thou dost
eo neglect. “1 must bc up betimes, aud do my dnty by the Quirinal? “What dntyf’'
“What duty! why my friend will take a husband-the marriage will be private.”
But soon there'll be no privaey, they'll want to put it in the news. And yet they
must dle barren (thie tormenta them), in spite of herbe and the Lupercns’ blows.

V. 14³. Bnt thie is less thau noble gladiatore, who soonr the arena, better bom than all
the tine folk who look on by the podium, yea than the great man too who gives the
gemes. Tho fablee about manes, Styx, and Charon’s boat we leave ιο babes. But
only think them true, and what would all those mighty spirits say when such a
shade caure downl They’d cry for luetral water, sulphur, piae, und laurel.

V. 159. So changed are wc, alus! Our arms are carried ιο thc furthest North, bnt those
barbarians do not what their conquerere do. Yet one, Armenian Zalatcs, moro soft
