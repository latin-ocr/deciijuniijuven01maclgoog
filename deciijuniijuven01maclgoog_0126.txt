SATIRA IV.

INTRODUOTION.

Thu man Crispinus mentioned iu the lirst satire (v. 26) as a corcomb who had beau im·
ported a slave, and had risen to consequence by the favour ol Domitian‚is here introduced
again. A pisce oi extravaganee ot his is made the handle for introducing the story ol a
fiah oi immense aize which was once caught in the Adriatic, and presented hythe flsher·
man to Domitian at his country palaea on the Alban lake. 'l'he tyrant, hy way of
showing his contempt ior the senate, summoned them suddenly, as if ou matters of state,
to attend him from Rome, sor the purpose of giving their opinions upon the lish aud the
manner of dressing it. 'lhe satire turns upon this point, the degradation of the senators,
some of them honoarable meu, whom, as well as others who were not so, he mentions by
neme. The poem was written aster the death of Domitian, which is referred ιο in the
last two lines. It is difficolt ιο say how soon aller, but Crispinus still retained the
wealth he had acquirad under Domitian, and we may believe it did not stay with him
long under the uextreigus. me slretehes or the different senatorsarevery good. They
are evidently drawn from liie3 and no better soene was wanted or eould be invented ιο
represent the object condition of the principal men of Rome under this insolent tyrant.

Crispinus here again-and he must osten play his part-monster, without a virtue
to redeem him. What use is all his wealth to him? 'lhe bad are never happy, much
less the adulterer aud the incestuous. But now of smsller matters3 though iu another
this were bad enough· But what is ιο be done where men ara worse than all that can
be said ol them?

. V. 15. He bought a mulletot' six pouuds for as many sestertia: not asa presentior
some rich old man or lor his mistress ς no, he bought it for himself. He, the Egyp
tian slave! a hah eost more than the man that caught it, osy, more than au estate
in the provinces. What shall we think that emperors eat when such a side-dish
gorges the parasite of the court, now lirst of equites, who used ιο cry stale ιιι in his
native place?

V. 34. let’s sit, Calliope ς tell a true tale, ye Musescbaste and young: andriace l call
you so give me your favour.

V, 37. When our last Flavius was torturing the world, it happened a buge ssah was
taken at Ancona, not less than they which osterwinter's ioe lloat lrom Maeotis to the
Euxine. The monster straight is marked sor the high-priest, for who would dare to
sell it with the coast lull of informers, ready'to swear the hah was reared in the
imperial ponda, and must go back to its lordi’ 'l'hey tell us all that's good in the sea
belongs to tbe privy porse, so it's sent as a present in isar ol confiscatiou.

V. 56. 'l'he winter had set in; the manin haste, as if 'twas summer and the lish would
spoil', makes for the palaea· And when he gete ιο the lakes where Vesta dwells, a
crowd admiring stops him; when it parts the doorally open 3 the senate waits with·
out. He's brought to tbe great meo. “decept (says he) an offeriug too big for
private tables: malso merry, eat, this ιιι was kept for Caesar's days. ltself was

· anxious ιο be caught.” 'l'be flattery ia ιοο gross, and yet his leathers rise,· gremmss y

will swallow any thing. But now there is uo dish to hold the monster. So he oallsa
mancii ol the men ha hstes, aud on whose l'aoes sit the terrore ol a great man’s

friendship.
