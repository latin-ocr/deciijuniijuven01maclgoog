woman’s cry: nosensible man thinks οι that: what good would it do ιι ιι could tortura
the man to death ι Besides, il ιι wanted revenge there was conscience to do that worlr
ιοι him, the hannting presence of the liar's gnilt spoiling his meala, favering his blood,
distnrbing his sleep, adding terror ιο ιιι ιιιιιιι· ιιι despair to sickness, hindering his
prayers and standing for ever between himself andths gods hs has offended. Nc sear οι
his repeating: nature will be too strong ιιι· him, ιιι will go bacis to ιιι guiltthat con·
sciense ιιι condemned; ιιι ιο ιι will go from sin ιο remorae, and back again ιο sin,
till ιι last he will be caught in his own snare, and come ιο ιιι punishment οι ιιι ιι1οι,
ιιι prove ιο ιιι satisfaction of the vindictivo soul ιιιι ιιι gods ιιι neither deas nos· blind.

Τιι satire takes ιιι form οι expostulation and ironicsl consolation throughout. It is
most familiarly known ιι dealing with ιιι subject οι ιι secusing conscience, which itdoes
in avery powcrfnl way from v. 122 totas. But this is only one part οι ιιι whole. ἰιι
character οι ιιι times ιιι ιιι contrast οι ιιι past sud present occnpy much οι ιιι poem,
aud there is ι very fiae passage describing the way in which men tamper with guiltand

, argue themselves into ιιι commission οι it, ιιι put on a bold face as οι ιιιοιιιιι, hom
v. 86 ιο 119.

Gidord says, “ Juvenal is here almost schristian,” ιιι ιι speaks οι ιιι doctrines cou-
taiucd iu thia satire “as οι such pnre, such sublime morality ’¹ ιι “the light οι ιιιιιι
alone was incapable οι discovering ς ιιι which the author undoubtedly derived from that
‘truc light ¹ which now began to glimmar through the Roman world? aad more ιο that
effect. I have made ι remark οι ιιίι subject in oue οι ιιι ιοιιι (v. 209). But iorths
chronological difficulty there nra many who would say that the same light glimmered in
the mind οι Socrates, whose visan of tho snpervisiou ot God and ιιι power of conscience
were not less clear than J nvenal’s, though wc hove no anch powerful exposition οι ιιι
ideas ιι we have hers. There never was a time when conscience did not exist in ιιι
mind οι man, however completely the habit of guilt may have secred it in some ιιι have
given scolour οι ἰιιοοιιιι ιο wickedness in the judginent ιι whole eommunitiea. What
Juvenal says on the subject os conscience derives ιιι only weight stom its ιιιιι ; ιιι
though he exaggerantes when he laada to tho inference that ιιι atinga οιι guilty conscience
must necessarily follow guilt, the picture hednaws is talren from experienee, net from
revelation, the experience οι ιιοιι who were ιο Christiana ιιι ιιι ιο knowledge ιο
frighten ιιιιι ιιι that which was suggested from within. The soliloquy (v. 92-105) in
which aman argues away ιιι misgivings with which he enters upon crime or the ιιιιιι οι
ιι, representa no doubt the conduct ιιι feelings οι many who have more light than that οι
conscience 3 but there too the man is not ι bad Christian, bnt ι bad pagan, sud if we ιιι
surprised to read ιι Juvenal laugnage or sentimenta which ιι delivered from ι Christian
pnlpit wonldbe appropriate ιιι searching, it isbecanse we are ιρι ιο surget that human
nataae, with its desires, its cormptions, and its sels-deceptione, has always been the same
in the main, and ιιιι (1οι ιιι never been without his witness against gnilt in ιιι heart οι
man. 'l'hat revengs is nnphilosophicsl ιιι vindictivencss the proof οι ι little mind may
be affinued without more light than man ιιι always possessed. But this doctrine iu par·
ticnlar it is οι which (lilios-d declaras that ‘⁴ neither Thales nor Chrysippus, no, nor his
great ιιιιιιι· Zeno ever taught or even conceivcd '' it. How does he know this? lle ιοιι
not add that Socrates did not act upon it, ss Juvenal (who does not look ιο Christianity
ιιι· his examples) says ho was ready to do. And if he acted the doctrine he preachcd
it, ιι, if Plato is ιο be trusted, ιι equally did in worda a cr if he did not Plato did it ιοι
him, and that comes ιο ιιι same thing.

ἰιι sum οι this is that ιιι reader had better take up this satire ιι representing ιιι
ιοιιιιοι moral sense οι mankind, and lools to the law ιι Christianity ιι confirming ιιι
nuwritten law οι which conscience has always been tho guardian and ιιι exponent, aud
οι which such writings as J nvenal’s, especially this poem, ara the cleas-est evidence.

Ruperti has pointed ont what ιι considers defecta in this satiro. Ηι says that the
