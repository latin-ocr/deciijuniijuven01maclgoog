D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Haud impunitum quondum fore, quod dubitaret 200 ·
Depositum retinere et fraudem jure tueri

J urendo : quaerebat enim quae numinis esset

Mens, et un hoc illi facinus suaderet Apollo.

Reddidit ergo metu non moribus; ιι tamen omnem

Perpetua anxietas nec mensae tempore cessat,

Faucibus ut morbo siccis, interque molares
Difficili crescente cibo: sed vina misellus
