LIFE OF JUVENAL. xxiii ’

institutiones a hanghty people‚ but now obedient to the, wantonness of
a tyrant who mocked its wealrness and played with its servility, is
amusingly shown in the l'ourth Satira. The fifth expones a different
sort of servility, that of parasitos, who sell their independence and
accept contempt for the sake ol' a meal grudgingly given, a low practice
which was more systematized at Rome, if it was not much more common,
than it is in our own country. The neglect os literary men has a Satire
ιο iteell‘ (the seventh); aristocratic pridehas another (the eighth). The
cunning os will-hunters is hit off at the end of the twelfth, which is not
among the most interesting of these compositione. It relates chiefly to
the arrival of a friend aiter a dangerous voyage, and is more of the
nature of a familiar letter than of a satire. The dishonesty of the age
ia described in the thirteenth Satire, which contains some of Juvenal’s
lineet verses, and shows him in the best character. This also is in the
form oi an epietle to a friend, and sois the eleventh, which contains an
invitation to dinnor, and contraets the poet's own plainnees of living with
the luxurioue habitsof his contemporaries. Thus J uvenal goes through all
the great scandale of his day, and treats them unaparingly. The crimes
and criminals of. former reigns are lieely introduced by way of illustra·¹
tion, bnt this is because the vioes of one reign represented those of
another, and the names of the dead could be more safely used than of
the living. Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Otho, Domitian, are all
brought up from time to time to point a moral or illustrate some espect
of crime. '

The meet celebrated of Juvenal’e poema, the tenth, has more of the
declamatory character, which some of his critice attribute to all. It is
on the vanity of human wishes, which is illustrated chiefly by historica}
examples, and the poem has not much bearing upon the particular
character of his times. It ia the lineet specimen os that sort of com·
position that I am acquainted with. The fifteenth Satire ia connected
with a scene of little general interest, an Egyptian squabble, Juvenal's
own interest in which ean only be accounted for by his having been in
the country where it happened. The last Satine, if it had been com·
pleted, would have furniehed a sketoh of military life, earcaetic but
good-hamonred, imm which a good deal of information might have been
derived.
