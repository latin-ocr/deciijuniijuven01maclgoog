xxxvi INTRODUCTION.

tc be interpolatione, and his judgment ou them may be viewed asa
challenge to all those who maintain that they are genuine. His repu-
tation as a critic will depend on his success or failure in establishing ¹
his opinion. The fourth Satira, as it stands, has an introduction of ³
thirty-six verses, which have been added, as Ribbeck assumes, by
aomo uuskilful hand. He is not the first critic or readcr who has felt
some surprise at finding a long Prologue to nothing, for the first thirty·

* six lines have no connexion with the real subject of the Satire, though
there are critica who admira this Prologue and think itis appro-
priate and a fine piace of composition. The beginning of the Prologue
announoes that Crispinus is again brought on the stage, aud the writer
declares hia intention to summon him often to play his part. We
expect that we are going to read a terrible invective against the fellow3
but after a few general remarks about his villany, we are told that the
present Satira will only treet of his smaller offences, and then comes the
particular charge against him of bnying a fish at an enormcns price,

ι and eating it himself. The mention of the fish is supposed by the
admirere of the Prologus to be a elever way of connecting the intro-
ducticn with the real Satira, the subject of which is the great fish thet
was presented to Domitian. But what becomes of Crispinus after this
flourishi Hc plays a most insignificant part in the scene before the
Emperor, and says not a word about the big fish, though something
would‘have been very much to the purpose from a man who was ⁴a ⁷
bnyer of fish, aud in his early days cried them through the streets of ⁴
Rome If Juvenal wrote this Prologue to the Satira, we canum
commend his taeta. Ribbeck goes into particulare, and examines

l various parts of this Prologue in order to confirm his general con-
demnation of it.

The other long passage, which 'Ribbeck treats as an interpolation, is
the Introduction of fifty-five lines which is prefixed to the eleventh
Satira. This Introduction resembles that to the fourth Satira in this
respect, that if you cut it off, you lose nothing of the real Satira, which
is an invitation to a friend to come and dine with J uvenal. This
friendly epistle is a charming composition, and reminds us, as Ribbeck
observes, of Horace’s humour and genial temper. If Juvenal wrote the
Prologue, he would have done better if he had commenced his epistle
at once without a preface.

This Essay also contains a short chapter on verses which have been
transposed in Juvenal's text, and on the passages where something
appears ‚to have been lost. The last chapter, written in Latin, is on
the famous sixth Satira, the disorderly arrangement of which the learned
critic has attempted to correct.

This ingenious Essay contains matter which a future editor of Juvenal
