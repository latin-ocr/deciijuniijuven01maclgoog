174 D. J UNII 'JUVENALIS

Vester porro labor fecundior, historiarum
Scriptores? petit hic plus temporis atque olei plus:
Namque oblita modi millesima pagina surgit 100
Omnibus ct multa crescit damnosa papyro.
Sic ingens rerum numerus jubet atque operam lex.
Quae tamen inde seges? terrae quis fructus apertae?
Quis dabit historico quantum daret actalegenti?

“Sed genus ignavum quod lecto gaudet et umbra.” 105
Dic igitur quid causidicis civilia praestent
Officia ct magno comites in fasce libelli.
