bresst? 'l'hc greet scul must uct be distmsed ιο find itseli s blenlretnit should
ouly look st horses, churiots, gods, und funos. ls Virgil hed not huda servent und ι
tolerable house, the snakes bed dropped from his fury's hesd, her trumpet hed been
dumb. We expect forsooth thet our poor plsywright should riso tc theold cothurnus,
who tc produce his play must pawn bis dishes und his cloelr. Poor Numitor bns
nothing for his friend, but plenty for his mistress aud bis lion-os course the brute
ests less thun s poet. Lucanus may lie in his flue gurdcus content with his grest
sume. but what is fame ιο such us poor Serrunm und Saleius, suppose they get it?
Statius rdelights the town who crowd to beer him; but efter ell he strrvcs is Puris
does not buy his pisy. Puris gives honours to thepoet-u plsyer does whst the great
should do! Yet will you psy your court to these noble people? Praefecto sud
tribunes come ot plnys3 but you’d not snvy him who gets his living by the stege.
Where will yon flnd me s Maecenas now, s Proculeius, hhbius, Cotta, Lentulus?

, Then genius wes rewarded, muny then found it worth while to psle their cheek with
study sud keep from wine through ull December's fesst.

V. 98—104. But is the historiru'slsbour more productivel It wsuts more time sud

then one would get to rcud the news.

V. los-149. But they're un idle herd. well, come ; what do the lawyers get for ull
their roering, especially when their client is in court end uudges them in the side?
Thon truly do they pud their lies like bellows, spluttering ull their breest. lf you
would know the hument thet they neap, put iu one scale s hundred lswyers’ putri·

Ajux rises to plendfor s men’s liberty with e clown for juder. Burst then your livet

this thet brought Pedo to bsnlrruptoy und Matho too: this wss Tongilius' tuin, ιο
who his great horn carried to the buths, disturbed the bethers with his dirty truiu,
sud through the forum lonnged, to buy ull manner of dne things, his lying purple
securing him credit. And yet these line clothes ere of use ; they given men his velue ;
it's their policy tc melre s noise eud weur the look of weelth, l'or Rome is prodigal
rud lrnows no bouuds to expense. Trust we our eloquenoei' Why Cicero would get
nothing uow unless ιο wore s great ring on his linger. No men employs you till
he hears how many slsves you keep. So Psulus hired s ring eud got more sees
then Basilus cr Cossus Eloquence in rugs is rere. tht chsnoe hus Besilus of

“Of course the teacher is in fault because the bey is s blochheed whose Hennibsl

themes sud go end prsctise recl strife in the courts. But it my counsel weigh with
