xxxii INTRODUC'PION.

been supposed 10 represent the handsome features attributed to Persius,
but they may be any body, and we must be content with 111οθ11111-
marian's testimony to his beauty.

Tus publishers 01 this edition of Juvenal and Persius, having deter-
mined 10 reprint the book, asked me to ,0011001 the sheets. Though very
busy about other things, Icould not refuse to perform this slight service
101 the work 01 my departed friend. Itis 101110 a cause of great regret
that Mr. Macleane did not live to revise this volume. His tastes and
his abilities particularly qualified him to be au editor 01 Juvenal and
Persius3 and as a first edition of such a book must be imperfect, he
would certainly have improved it, if he had lived long enough. His
knowledge of the world, his strong sense, quick perception, and souud
judgment, applied 10 a second edition, might have produced a work that
would have satisfied the readers 01 Juvenal aud Persius 101 some time.
What 110 has done however is well worth preserving, and I believe that
future editors-and iu due time they will appears-may find iu the Intro·
ductione, Argumenta, and Notes, much matter that will help them towards
the meaning 01 the Satirists. Ido not think that Mr. Macleaue has
often missed the sense of his authors, and he has certainly seized
it sometimes where other editors have not. He possessed one quality in
a striking degree-a bold aud independeut judgment, without which au
· editor is in danger 01 being confused aud misled by a great variety of
opinions. His notes show the character 01 his mind. He often ex·
presses his opinion very positively, and sometimes perhaps in away that
may offend3 but he had a sincere respect 101 good sense and sound
knowledge in others3 he had none of the feeble 00110011 which often goes
with what is termed learning, aud he had some reason to feel confidenct
in his own judgment, for few men were so quick in detecting au
absurdity or went ao straight 10 the meaning 01 11 thing. The intro·
ductiou to the thirteenth Satira of Juvenal is an evidence of his large
aud liberal views on a subject on which many who belong to his profes·
sion, aud even others who do not, have uttered and ‚still utter their
wretched eommonplacos.

I have not altered the text of this edition, and in only a few
places the punctuation. Ihave added a collation 01 this text ol
Juvenal with that 01 Jahn, whose usefsd edition is now generally
