xxx INTRODUC'PION.

He wanted ten days to complete his twenty-eighth year. Α paragraph
in the memoir, which is from a later hand than the first part, says hs ’
died of adisease of the stomach. This is probably au inventiomand
there is no other evidence of the cause of his death. From the company
he kept, his political feelings must have been well known, and had he
lived longer he might have shared the fate of his most intimate friends,
of whom Thrasea, Seneca, Lucanus, were put 10 death, and Cornutus
was banished.

He left behind him, besides the productione of his early years above
referred 10, nemore than the six Satires in this book ¹, the last of which,
as appears plain to me from the ending, as well as from the obvious
meaning of the Grammarian’s words, he must have left unfinished
These he probablyhad communicated only 10 his intimate friends during
his life; but after his death, Cornutus, whom he probably ¹left his
executor, having slightly revised the Satires, gave them to Caesius Bassus,
at his (Bassus') nequest, 10 edit. Attempts have been made to traca the
corrections of Cornutus, one of those tasks that certain understandings
delight in. Τ100 famous line noticed by the Grammarian (S. i. 121)
may very well have been written by Persius, as he says; and though his
editor could not have published it without bringing disgrace and per·
haps destruction 00 himself, and the alteration may therefore be excused,
the verse cannot be said to have been mended by the substitution of the -
words that now form part of the text. When the volume was published
it immediately attracted attention, and was much read and admired.
Since Horace no oue of any ability had put forth writings of this kind,
and in these Satires there was found much 10 remind the public of their
favourite poet, combined with a great deal of originality and genius.
Persius' intimate acquaintance with Horace's poems appears in a great
number of passages, most of which show that uncouscious imitation
which is the surest sign of the minute study of au author. Casaubon
has collected a large number of parallel passages from the two authors,
some of which may perhaps be a little strained.

Persius is said by his biographer 10 have been slew in composition.
This is very likely. His verse does not flow in a rapid and muddy

⁸ . stream like that of Lucilius, as Horace describes him (S. i. 4), but as

he says himself “caedit pluteum et demorsos sapit ungues ” (S. i. 106).
Ηο has evidently taken Horace's advice (S. i. 10. 69, sqq.) too literally,
aud corrected himself till his language has¹ become short and the ideas
condensed, to a degree that makes the sense in some places obscure.
Modern readers have found great fault with the poet 00 this account.

ἱ Βο1 I think the obscurity has been exaggerated, and that, except
