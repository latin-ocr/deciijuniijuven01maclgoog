V. 114. “ speaking of Greeks, let's pose to the Gymnesie end te s crime ef de'eper dyc.
Think of thet Stoic who killed Beres, betrayed hie friend end pupil, the old wreteh

lies peculim to their tribe; so ull my faithful services ere gone It mettere nothing
now tolose e client.

V. 126. “What ere s poor men'e services, when prsetore rnsh before thern to do their

end here's more stud' to stir your bile; we must puy toll, sud swell the seringe of the
