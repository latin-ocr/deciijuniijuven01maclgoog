INTRODUOTION.

h. Amanus cossurus, to whom this satire is οοοτοοοοο, as sntod iu tho Introduction, Ι

was the instructor of Persius, who went to him as soon as he came to muu's estate, to
leam the Stoic philosophy. He was a native of one of tho two places in Libya named
Leptis (Κορνοῦτος ltrrrirns φιλόσοφος· ἡ blllfrrss πόλιοΛιβύης. Suidas, Κορνοῦτος).
His name shows him to have beeu a fraedman of οπο of the Annaei, of which family
there were many woalthy branches. Senem was one of them, aud was 'a friend of
Cornutus. 'l'he poet Lucan was au Annaeus, aud one of his pupils. Dion emin,
(62, ο. 29) says that Nero, intending to write a Roman history in Epic verse, musulted
Cornutus ss to the number of books it should be in. Some of his flatterars told him they
should he four hundred, but Cornutus said πο οπο would read them. And when some
one said Chrysippus, the Stoic, had written many more, Cornutus answered that his
books had something useful in them for human life. Whereupon Nero sent him into
exile. This must heve been after the death of Persius, an. 62. According to ,ῆι-ωηο .
it was in 68, the last year of Nero's reign, [but according to Dion it was before tho
consulship of Telesinus, and therefore before nc. 66.]

'lha Sotira turns upon the character aud teachiug of Cornutus. It is supposed to bo
delivered in conversation with him, and the introductioh is well arranged. Penius
begins by referring to the commonplaceof poets asking the Musa for a hundred tongues ς
οπο Cornutus asks what he cau be about, and hopes he is not going to write a tragedy
or an Flpic poem. lle auswers that he wenta this gith of tongues to tell his affection
and gratitudo towards his friend and toacher, whom he addresscs in affectionata lan·
gurgo, declaring that their fatos are the same, and their lives nuder the protection of
the same star. lle eontracta the earnest life of his master, devoted to study aud to
the instruction of the young, with thc various selfish pursuits of tho world; aud he
takes that opportunity to urge upon old aud young the stusly of philosophy. Ono os
the tenete of the Stoica is that which is dwelt upon at length in the seventh satire of
Horace's second book, and in the noh of Cicero's Paradoxa, of which the title is trs
μόνος d σοφὸς δλοοθεροο rel ras tepor δοῦλος. 'l'alring up this doctrine Persius occupies
the rest of his Satira with illustrations of it, showing that real liberty is not that of
the slave set free hythe Praetor, though with his frecdom he may get the world to
worship him, aod fancy heis at liberty to livens be pleases. These notions he treats
as old wives’ ruso for the Praetor cannot touch a mun the duties of life and how to
enjoy it, any more than he can teach ο low fellow to play the harp. A man oonnot (10
what he plenses, for he cau only do what he is tlt for. If he isupright, and disceruing,
and just, sud moderate, οπο kind, aud liberal without extravaguuce, sud free from
avafice, he is ο free man3 but if not, he is ss much ο slave as the mun that carries his
masters things to the bath, aud is flogged if he loiters ou the way. There are those,
he goes on to say, who are slaves alternately of avarica and sels-indulgence, but who
believe themselves free notwithstanding. 'l'he youth who has summoned courage to
give up his mist'rcss after she has ill-treated him, and thinks be is going to leod a now
life, finds his liberty is uot proof against the first invitation to return. 'lhe ambitione

man is the slave of the mob, the superstitious of his ferare aud of the knsves that impone

77, sqq), whose business, of course, itis to ridicule these οπο sentimenta. This abrupt-
