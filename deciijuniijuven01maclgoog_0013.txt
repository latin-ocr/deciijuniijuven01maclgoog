viii PREFACE.

. Of the English translations Ι have referred to, those of Dryden
0 and Gifford are the ablcst. Dryden has not translated all the
Satires. Holydafs is a quaint piece of rhyming prose, with some
learned notes. He often hita the sense where others miss it. Dr.
J ohnson's imitatione of the third and tenth Satires I have notioed
in their places. Happening to have the Italian translation by
Teodoro Accio (Lugano, 1828), 1 have sometimes referred to it;
and have found it, as far as Ι have done so, sensihle and osten
Ι correct. Ibelieve it has a high reputation in Italy.

Having edited Horace for this mnas, I have referred freely to my
own notes in that edition. Ι hope Ι shall not appear egotistieal in
so doing. I must either have taken this course, or repeated almost
word for word what I had written before.

This has been found still more necessary with respect to Persius,
who has imitated Horace so freely as to compromiae his character
for originality, though he has maritans well as defecta that are
his own. . ι

This author has latcly hoen edited (Leipzig, 1843) with much
care by Otto Jahn, whose edition of Juvenal is mentioned above.
His notes on Persius are in the style of Ruperti’s on Juvenal,
though they have more merit. Readers who wish to be referred to
a great variety of authors and oritics, will use Jahn's edition for
that purpose ¹. For the author's meaning Heinrich ia a better guida
in my opinion. His notes were edited attha request of his son by
Jahn the year atter his own edition, and seven years aster the death
of Heinrich. 'lhey are shorter and less elaborate even than those ⁶
on Juvenal, but whatever Heinrich says is to the purpose and the
¹ fruit of his own intelligenee. The freshness of that sort of com-
mentary is very pleasant to vthose who have waded through a sea
of complicated notes, in which every thing more or less remotely
bearing upon the text is brought in to smother it. When are

authors tc be made their editors' first and only consideration ?'
‘I'he edition of Casaubon represents the learning of that great

¹ J ahn’s Prolcgomena on the'Life aud Scholia and MSS. of Persius are the bost part
of his book. 'l'hough long aud rather tedicus, thoy aro scholarlike aud uscfnl.
