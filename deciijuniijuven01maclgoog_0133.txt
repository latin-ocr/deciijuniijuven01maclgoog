D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Autumno, jam quartanam sperantibus aegris,

Stridebat deformis hiems praedamque recentem

Servabat: tamen hic properat velut urgeat Auster:
thue lacus suberant, ubi quanquam diruta servat 00
Ignem 'Ihojanum et Vestam colit Alba minorem,
Obstitit intranti miratrix turba parumper.

Ut cessit, facili patuerunt cardine valvae 3

Exclusi spectant admissa obsonia Patres.
