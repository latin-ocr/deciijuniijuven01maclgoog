SATIRA ΙΙ.

Haec emis hirsuto spirant opobalsama eollo

Quae tibi? Ne pudeat dominum monstrare tabernae.
Quod si vexantur leges ac jura, citari

Ante omnes debet Scantinia. Respice primum

Et scruta-re vir0s3 faciunt hi plura: sed illos 45
Defendit numerus junctaeque umbone phalanges.

Magna iuter molles concordia. Non erit ullum
Exemplum in nostro tam detestabile sexu.

'Pedia nou lambit Cluviam, nee Flora Catullam:

Hispo subit juvenes et morbo pellet utroque. 50
Numquid nos agimus causae, civilia jura

Novimus, aut ullo strepitu fora vestre movemus?
