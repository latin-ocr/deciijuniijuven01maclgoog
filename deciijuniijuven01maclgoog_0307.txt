. INTBODUOTION.

Juvauan invites his friend, whom hc calls Persicus, to diuum, and prepares him t'or
plain fure by observatione on-the conduct of those who with small means effect the
indulgenoes os the rich. and who aquander the little they have upon their belly. This
extravaganoe hs mocintcs with aelf-ignorum, and takes occasion to commend that
