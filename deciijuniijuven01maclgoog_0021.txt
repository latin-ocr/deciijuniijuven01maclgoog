xvi INTRODUCTION.

' Hadrian succeeded Trajan in 111. 117, and there is an allusion 55 5115
silence 51 5115 515515 51 Delphi in vi. 555, which makes it appear that the
Satira was written before the reign of Hadrian, or at its commenoement,

’ 151 115 restored that oraclo which Nero had stopped. This probably

took place during Hadrian's residonce at Athens, 511. 123-126.

It is not certain in what years of his reign Hadrian erected the mag-
nificent palace 11551 Tibur, of which the ruins still exist ; probably not
before 511. 134. But it is certain it was 1155 built when Juvenal wrote
11151511155511511 Satira, or he would 11515 referred to it among the build-
ings he names vv. 86-91.

But the seventh Satira, which has boen the subject of so much disputo,
appears 55 1115 to bear the strongest internal evidence of having been
written iu Hadrian's reign. He was an author himself, and the patron
51 authors, aud Juvenal could not have said this 51 any 515115 551151
emperors that preceded him without egregious flattery, 51 which he was
inoapable. The statement of the Scholiast that 111 that Satira “Nero-
nem palpat '' is not worthy 51 notice.

The fifteenth Satire turns upon an event said to have happened
“nuper Consule Junio” (v. 27) ¹. It may not be possible to say with
certainty which consul Junius he refers to. But my own opinion, and
that of many others, is, that it was Junius Rusticus who was consul in
511. 119, 5115 second year of Hadrian’s reign. I cannot doubt 51155111
this Satire ὖ 5151151 refers 55 1115 own experience of Egypt during a resi·
donce there in former years. Heinrich’s pupil, Francke, has taken
great pains 55 show that Juvenal had never been in Egypt. But he is
obliged to get rid 51 55 many verses as spurious which 1 believe to 115 as
genuine as any in the Satira, that his arguments are 51 no value in my
opinion. Itis possible Juvenal may have been 111 Egypt before 511. 84,
when the only other Junius, Appius Junius Sabinus, was consul, that
being tho third year of Domitian's reign. In that case the whole story
51 his exile by Domitian becomes afable, asthe details 51 15 manifestly

are, unless it be said that the Satire was written in Egypt, or, 11 written
at Rome, that the poet had beon recalled by the emperor who sent him

⁷ Jahn and 0. F. Hermann, in their editions, have adopted the 1511555 Junoo for
1111115, from Pithoeus' 118. Hermann, 111 his Dissertation on the 55155511 Satira
(Gottingen, 1855), takes ‚lunius Rusticus 151 5115 consul, but in 5115 praiaco to his
edition (1854) he argues for 155555, who, he says, was Consul Suffectus 155127. Ι
adhere to J unius ς but Hermann’s date, whichis eight years later, would not materially
551555 5115 view 1 take of the poet's 551551. J uncas does not appear in the Fasti till
111. 182, and Hermann, in his Dissertatiou, doubts the existence 51 an earlier Jnncusz
