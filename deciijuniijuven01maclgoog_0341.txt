292 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

V. 86. Some ssy chonee governo all things, nature rules the world. end so they feurless
go to eny sltsr. Others believe in gods and punishment, bnt argue thus: ‘⁴ laet them
do with my body whet they will, end striks me blind, so thet 1 keep my gains. We
moy bear sll for thet. Lsdss if poor will prey for the rich msn's gout, unless he be
insene- 'Ihe rscer’s berrenerown, what does he get by that l The gods msy punish,
bnt they punish slew: my turnwill not beyet; besides it moy bethey will perdon me ς
the fsnlt is veniel. It’sall s chance, one geins s cross by his crimes eudone e crown.'’
'Tis thus they quiet conscience, put s bold face upon it, go to the altor of their own

. accord, sbuseor best yon for mistrusting them, und get believed for their endsdty.
And so they set their feres, while yon ery ont with voice like Stentor or like Mors,
“Jove, hesrest thou in silence? Why do we bring thee sacrifice ond incense? As
fer ss 1 οιιι see your statues ere no better then ngellins’.''

V. 120. Now take such comfortss yon mayfrom one unreod in ull philosophy. Patients
in danger moy consult great doctore, do you submittes humbler. 11 yon esu prove
there never was ι crime so bed in sll the worldl hold my pesce, mourn ss yon
will ; Ilrnow the loss of money is e grestm grief then loss of kindred 3 in thet osse
mourning isnot seigned, the tesrs ere resl. But if it's every where the seme'thst meu

yonrself the ehiek of a line bird sndustheproduee of s hnmble nest? It’s hntesmsll
thing ester ull if you oompere it with the greater crimes, the hired emmiu, the incen-
disry, the mruegious robber who plunders templa, οι· the petty thiel who scrupos
the gold hem ststnes; the poisoner, tho parricide. How small a port is this of sll
the crimes the preesset linteus to from mern till night l His court alone will tesoh

V. 162. None wonder ot swelled throets in the Alps, eosrse bressts in Egypt, or blus
eyes und yellow curly bsir in Germsny, becsuoe they ere oll the some. So no one
among the pigmies lsughs st their bottles with the ornnes, though they ers only s
foot high.

y V. 174. “ But must not perjnry and frsudhepnnished ?” Suppose him carried oflj end
pnt to desth, your loss is still the seme, und all yon got is odium snd s drop of blood
shed from s heedless eorpse.

V. 180. “ Oh! bnt revenge is plesssnter then life.” This is fools’ lsngnege, who flere
up lor nothing. Chrysippus, Thales would not say so, nor Socrates, who would not
share his enp of poison with his enemy. Philosophy correcto our t'nnlts of nstnre and
of practice ι she tint taught ns right from wrong, for only little minds esre for revenge,

V. 192. But why think they osespe whom conscience whips? Their punishment is worse
thnn sny down in hell, who night end dsy eerry their witness with them. 'l'he Sparten

who thinks to do sn evil deed incure the gnilt es n be'd done the deod. what if the

who tremble st the storm end think euch bolt ιι messenger of wrath. If one storm

diocese they count a stone or dnrt from hesron. 'l'hey dere not sscriflee in
