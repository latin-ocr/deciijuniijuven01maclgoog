LIFE OF PERSIUS.

Tan principal facts of Persius’ lile may be gethered from a memoir of
which the following is a translation. The author, by some supposed to
be Suetonius, cannot be conjectured with probability. It appears in
most of the old MSS. of Persius, and in some of the oldest is said to be
extracted from a commentary of Valerius Probus. That name is given
to other memoirs besides this, and whether it represents one, or two, or
several early Grammarians, is uncertain. Thereis‘no‘do‘ubt however
'that the account is very old, and the statements have an air of truth
which is confirmed by internal evidence. Tharais little in Persius'
writings on which to construet an imaginary biogrnphy, and this is so
far a guarantee for the genuineness of this Grammarian's facts.

“Aulus Persius Flaccus was born the day before the nones of December,
in the consulship of Fabius Persicus and L. Vitellius ¹. He died the
eighth day before the kalende of December, in the consulship of P.
Marius and Asinius· Gallus ¹. lle was born [in Etruria⁸], at Volaterrae,
a Roman eques, by blood and marriage connected with men of the
highest rank. He died at the eighth milestone on the Appian rond, on
his< own estate. His father Flaccus left him a minor, about six years
old. His mother Fulvia Sisennia afterwards married Fusius, a Roman
eques, and him too she buried within a lew years. Flaccus pursued his
studies until his twelfth year at Volaterrae3 after that at Rome with
the grammarian Remmius Palaemon, and the rhetorician Virginius
Flavus ⁴. When he was sixteen years old he first began to enjoy the
friendship of Annaeus Comutus‚ to whom he became so much attached
that he never left him, and by him he was initiated to a certain extent
in philosophy. Hs had for his friends from his earliest youth, Caesius

Bassus, and Calpurnius Sura ⁸, who died young during Persius' lifetime.
