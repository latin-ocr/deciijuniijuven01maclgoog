scholar. It 1100 been lately republished by Duebner (Leipzig, 1839),
with the text revised but not improved by this editor, who has
added to casaubon’s notes the conflicting opinions of 0111010001-
mentators. The notes 01 Lubinus are so wordy and embarrassed
as 10 be quite unreadable. Plum and Koenig have fumished the
world with long commentarios, of which Plum’s is the better. Pas-

sows edition (Leipzig, 1809) is accompanied by a German 110110-

In 00000 01 difficulty I have not been able 10 1011 upon his judg-
ment. Orelli has given the text, scholia, and many 01 the various
readings of Persius in his Eclogae Poetarum Latinorum. His text
is good, and Ι have never failed 10 00001101 itwith respect. Every
011101 who thinks 00 he ought, independently, will have his own
opinion of his author’s meaning3 and so will choose, 0111 01 many
that may have authority, that reading which best represents his
opinion. With this remark 1 disclaim any want 01 proper deferende

scholars 01 the early 111110 001110 production 01 0110 person, and 110
no other 111011 Annaeus Cornutus, the 1000110101 Persius. It does
not require much discrimination to see that they 010 00111010 that
source, and 10 not 0001010 0 syllable that was written near the time

is a great deal 01 000101 0111 0 great deal 01 foolish matter in these

01 the MSS. 01 Persius Jahn has mentioned and described sixty-
