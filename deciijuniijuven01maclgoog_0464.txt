SATIRA V. 415

γ lond? hlerous is Judex, who shall bo afraid? Marsus has spoken, oud it must be
true! Marenslprsyyou sign and real mywilll This is pure liber-tyr the cop of
freedom gives us this!

V. 83. ‘But who is free but he who does what he lilios? Illve aa Iplease‚ and am 1
not more free theu Brutus i’ Your inferendo is bad, the saga replies. 1 grurm γοο ull
hutthet, ‘I live as Iplease! ‘Why not, now that I’re got my heodem from the Praetor
-so long, at least, as 1 keep within the lawl’ Now put aside thet augry loolr, und
I'll relieve γοο of these old wives’ tales. 'l'he Praetor oould not teaeh youths
subtlo offiees os life, and how to use it. As soon shall low slaves play the harp.
Reason forbids thet any should do that which they must spoil in dolug3 tho lnws of
mun ond nature say thesemo. 'l'he ignorant must not mingle medieinesz eplough-
meu taking to s ship were shameless. Say, have you learnt to welk uprightly? Το
know sound from uusoundl To set their true marles upon things, whether to be
pnrsued or-shunned? Andura yon moderate in your wishes aud your life? kind to
your friends? liberal, but not extravaguut? no longing eye for moneys not your
own? When you eun say. ‘all this is mine' bs free und wise in Pmetor’s nume and
J ove’s. But if within you're only what γοο were, then 1 retract, you’re nought in
reason's eye; only put forth your fingeraud γοιι err ς folly aud right ean never dwell
'together3 the ditoher cannot dunoe Bathyllus’ Satpr. Youfree, the servant of so
many masters! Suppnss you're sale from the lusis, have you no lord within to
punish you? ι

V. 132. See, Avarico waher yon up from sleep end bids pon go sud trade, bargain, and '
lie: fool! uevsr mind though Jove should overhear you. Thon oll' yon sturt till
suf-indulgence bida you pause: ‘Medmam where go you? Yon to oross the aeas,

· tosit upon eooilofrope, eat offabeuch, anddrinkred wine of Veii? Andallto
double the fair interest you're getting on your eapitsl. Indulge yonrsels; the
moment that we live is ours ; you'll soon bs turned to dunt γ for time is dying, death
will soon bs here.¹ See your dilemma. Now you must serve this master und now
that. And though yon onoe reaist pon ennnot say you're fres. Thes dog may break
his chain, bnt drags e good part nster him.

V. 161. Chaerestratus declares he'll mend his ways, and vait no longer ut a harlot's
door. ‘Well done, young master,' Davus eries. ‘But do you think she'll be
unhappy, Dnvusl' Ofoolish bey, she'll beet yon with her shos. Fumo not, youtallr
lieres now, but when she calls you back you’ll go in e moment. It would not be so

V. 174 Αγο, whole and souud, here is the thing we want3 notin the lietor’s rod. Is
that man free, led by ambitiou open-mouthed llinging his largess to the people?

V. 179. When the J ews' feast eomes round you mutter prayers and tremble ut their
sabbatha. Or ο blsek ghost, or broken egg, or Cybele’s great priests, or Isis'
priestess, threatens you with plagues unless you eat s head of gerlio thrioe in tho
mormng.

V. 189. Now tell sll this to the neptuim, and they'll laugh and swear these Greeks ure
barely worth one as u-pieoe.
