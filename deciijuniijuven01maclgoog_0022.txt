LIFE OF JUVENAL. 'xvii

away, for it was written shortly after the consulship of Junius, and
therefore, if Sabinus be the man, 11 116 middle or towards the beginning
of Domitian’s reign. But it will be shown below that the banishment
could 111 have happened till late in Domitian's reign, and I believe
Hadrian’s consul, «Iunius Rusticus, is meant, and that the Satira was
written early in Hadrian's reign, that is about 11. 121, 11 two years
after 116 consulship of «Iunius ⁸.

In Sat. xiii. 17 16 speaks of Calvinus, the friend he addresses, as
then sixty years old, and bomin the consulship of Fonteius. I think
it almost certain that the consul referred tois L. Fonteius Capito, cos.
11. 59, and that therefore 116 Satira was written towards th'e be·
ginning of Hadrian's reign, and not earlier than 11). 119.

Τ16 earlier date to which Lipsius and others refer 11, as stated 11 my
note (xiii. 17), is forty-seven years before the reign of Hadrian.
Either, therefore, Juvenal did 111 write at all in that reign, or this
Satira was written while Hadrian was emperor, about Am. 119.
Otherwise Juvenal’s Satires must range over a period of fifty years 11
11616111111, and oneof the very best must have been nearly the earliest.
Those who are of opinion that the allusion to Meroe in v. 163 of this
Satire, resulted from personal observation, must be prepared 11 admit
116 later date, or to suppose that the banishment of Juvenal to Egypt
by Domitian is altogether fabulous, and that his visit 11 1111 country
must have been early in the reign of Vespasian‚ if not before it, since
the Satire, according to 116 11161 hypothesis, must have been written
about the fourth year of that reign, and 1116 years before Domitian
became emperor.

Thus the sixth‚ seventh, thirteenth, and fifteenth Satires have internal
evidences by which they may be referred 11 116 reign of Hadrian, and
of these the three last, Ι have 11 doubt, were 'written under that
emperor. =

But if we 1111111. 12011 116 111611 date of which there is evidence,
how far back may we go to determine the author’s agel

It is nearly certain that the first Satira was written in Trajan's reign,
not long after the banishment of Marius Priscus, 11. 100.

Τ16 reference to war on the Euphrates in the eighth Satira (v. 51)
makes it probable that the poem was written during the Armenian and
Parthian wars (1.1. 114-116), 11 116 611111 of which (1.1. 115)

⁸ Ruperti, 1 think, 11 right in saying “Satira xv. hoc forte 1111 scripta (121) non
superiore, nam 11 tam recem funum esset qnod 11 61 narrat, poeta opinor 1. 27 simpli·
citer dixisset ‘napea' naqne arficcisset ‘Consule J 1111 ' '' (Vita Jnv. per annos digesta,
vol. i. p. xxx). This commentator thinks that Juvenal, now in 111 eighty-first year, vas
suspected of having written Satira vii. against Hadrian, and was banished hy him.
Poor old man!
