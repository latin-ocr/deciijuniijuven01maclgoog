INTRODUCTION.

Tme satire professes to be eddreaeed to one Ττειὶοο, the representative of a claae os
men, who being poor and exquisitely servile, were nilling ιο part with their indepen-
dence and pnt np with all rorte of contemptuons treatment for the sake os a dinner at
the tables of the rich. Δ specimen os ench a dinner is given, at which Virro the host
reserves for himself and hie rich frienda the best of every thing, meat and fruit end
wine, and the parasitee are sullsily served with the norst, hy slaves too tine to malie up
to the gueats for the master'e neglect. J uvenal'e conclusion ia, that they who will put
ι np with ench treatment deserve it; and the rich meu is not much ιο blame if hc
despiees those who are only drawn to his table by the noae, that is, by the eavour of
hie lritchen.

'lhe satire hae ite moral for modern society, in which, if the relation οι host and
guest ieprevented by good breediug from taking the form here represented, eating and
servility are scarcely lese prominent features than they were at Βοοοο in its woret
days 1r the rich loolr down upon the poor, it is usually beoaw os the homage rank

and riches meet with, and that this homage eomes of selflehnese none know better ,

than those who receive it. 'l'he eoveting os what ie called good society is the viee of a
rotten system and the man who seclis company which does not want him has no
reason to complain it' his pride is galled and hie expectatione are disappointed. If there
were no Trebinses in the world there would be no Virroe: so Juvenal thought; and ho
does well to lay the chief weiglrt of hie satire upon the parasite.

'l'ha parasite, or dinen-out, of later times had οο resemblance to the client of the
repnbhc. He was no more than one of many in th'e train of a rich man, or of aa many
rich meu as hc could get attached ιο in that mean capacity. 'l'he old relation of
‘patronus' and ‘cliens,' οο far as we een understand it, was simple and natural. The

other was the mere refuge of poverty, preferring the breed of idlenese and a false ¹

longua to a life ol* honest labour end the rewarde of an independent mind. Τοο
student will only be mieled if, following some os the commentatore, he loolre upon the
latter condition aa only another phase os tha former. 'Phe old institution died out with
the republic it belonged to; the medem practice was the fruit of human corruption,
and hae ita analogies in all agee of society, ench es ie called civilired.

ARGUMENT.

charges, and submitting to any thing fora diuum, 1 would not believe yon on your
