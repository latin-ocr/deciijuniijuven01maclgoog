INTRODUCTION. xxxv

no difficulty about. So far as this I admit: he has proved clearly
enough that ⁴there are very manifest differences between the matter and
the style of the ten Satires which he assigna to Juvenal, and the five
which he has handled so unmsrcifully. These five Satires are marred
by great faults, and contain comparatively t'ew good lines. They ars v
indeed feeble compositione as satiras, when compared with the vigorous
work of the earlier pisces, the best of which are perhaps those which
cannot be read with young men If any Satire of the five is to be
exceptcd from this general condemnation, it is the thirteenth; but many
parts even of that Satin) are open to just censius. As to the famous
tenth, if we do not except tc the matter, we may allow that there is
some merit in the manner in which the subject is treated; but even if
this admissiou is made, it is still nothing more than a frothy declama·
tion. Both the matter and the style of the tenth form a striking contrast
to another Satine, the third, which is justly admired. Itis a living
picture. ’

The question then is, whether the same man wrote or could write all
these Satires, a question which Ribbeck answers by affirming that he
could not; and he labours hard to prove his assertion. But it isim·
possible to say what a man may do in the way of writing‚ for the same
men nave wrcen wiso books anu consu books, bas poesy anu good
poetry. The sams difficulty exists as to some of Cicero's orations,
which are so bad that some excellent critice maintain that Cicero
could not have written them 3 buton the other hand there are critice,
both old and new, who admira the spurious orations, and think they are
very fine.

As to the sixteenth Satira, which is manifestly a fragment, it is
admitted by Ribbeck that this may be a piece os the true Juvenal's
work.

In a second chapter Ribbeck discusses the interpolations in the ten
Satires. His hypothesis, he says, about the five Declamations would
fare badly, if we accepted the ten Satires in their present form as the
genuine work of Juveua13 for all the faults which bave led him to
reject the five Declamations, are found here and there in the ten
Satires3 and these bits of patchwork resemble so much the whole texture
of the five Declamations, that is we allow them to stand where they
are, we must admit that the poet could exhibit in the same Satire the
skill of a master aud the stupidity of a bungler. However, there is no
necessity, he says, for this admission, for the ten Satires are dis·
figured by interpolatione which have been remarked on by many recent
critics; and indeed nobody who has read Juvenal with any care will
deny that there are interpolated verses. Ribbeck has only increased the
number of them. There are two long passages, which Ribbeck assumes
