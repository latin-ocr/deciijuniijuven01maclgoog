LIFE OF PERSIUS. xxvii

Annaeus Cornutus, a philosopher of the Stoic school, to which most
men of thought at that time belonged. Το Cornutus he became much
attached, and the friendship continued to the end of his life. His obli·
gations to this excellent manha feelingly acknowledges in the fifth
Satira. While he was at school he appears ιο heve written a comedy;
also a poem, probably of a humorous cast, which he called Ὀδοιπορικά,
Wayside Verses, or The Traveller, or whatever it may heve been, and
some verses on the death ef his kinswoman Auia. She was the wife of
Coccina Paetus, who for treason was put to death by Claudius. The
allusion in the life is ιο her conduct on this occasion. Paetus was
required to be his own executioner. His wife, who loved him devotedly
and had declared she would die with him, took a dagger, stabbed herself,
drew it out, and handed it ιο her husband, and said, “ Paetus, it is not
painful ‘.'' This happened aa). 42, before Persius was eight years old.
These early productione his mother kept till her death, and then, by the
judicious advice of Cornutus, destroyed them.

How soon alter his father's death his mother married again, it is im·
possible to say. But that she remained with her two children, Aulus
aud his sister, at Volaterrae, till the boy was old enough ιο go to Rome,
and that she continued ιο superintend his education till he went ιο
Cornutus, may be assumed. The Scholiast, on S. vi. 6, says that after
the death of her first husband she married in Liguria, where Persius was
staying when thet Satine was written. It is more likely that she retired

ιο this part of the country, ιο a house left her by her second husband,
after his death, leaving hersen ιο parsue his studies under the guidance
and roof of Cornutus ⁸.

At this time he formed an intimate acquaintance with that Caesius
Bassus to whom the last Satine is addressed, and with Calpurnius Sura,
of whom however we know nothing more than the Grammarian tells us,
thet he died young, and that Persius survived him.

⁸ See Pliny, hipp. iii. 16. Martial (1.14) has an epigram on this event:

‘⁴ Casta suo gladium cum traderet Arria Pacta
Quem de visceribus traxerat ipsa suis,

‘Si qus fides viduus quod feci noa dolet,’ iuquit,
‘Sed quod tu facies hoc mihi, Paete, dolet! ’³

⁸ From Persius' way of speaking of Lunae Portas it has been supposed by some that
he was born there. But independently of the express testimony of the Grammarian,
thare is presumptive evidence in the name of Sisennia, which is Etrurian, and in Arria
his kinswoman haring married Caecina, whose family wera natives of Volaterrae, ιο con-
firm the statement that Persius was born there. There isos course no weight to be ·
attached to the tradition which is mentioned only, as far as I know, in Bayle’s notice of
Persius iu his Dictionary, that a medem himily of Voltorra (the Falconeini) are derived
from Persins' father, who had bnt oue sou, and he died unmarried. From the mma.
source I leam thatahoase was shown scantury ago at volterra ss that of Persius. ¹
