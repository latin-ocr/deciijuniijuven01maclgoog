LIFE OF JUVENAL. xv

that the emperor in a despatch addressed ιο him with the army, wrote '
these words, “et te Philomela promovit” (alluding to his own epigram),
and that, learning from this the anger of the emperor, he died of a

broken beart. ’

The sixth memoir makes Trajan the emperor, Paris being still the
hero of the epigram, and a'grees with the fifth about Scotland.

Α seventh agrees substantially with the first, except that the emperor
is said to have been Nero.

Theos seven are published at the end of Jahn's edition.

It seems clear that not one of these notices is original. They have
come, ond that not at first hand probably, from two or three common
stocks, which have been confounded according ιο the fancy of the
writer 3 and whatever amount of truth there may have been in the
originale has been perverted and confused in the later editions, which
show very little evidence of accurate informatiou.

The only authority for Juvenal's birthplaee contained in his poema is
in Sat. iii. 319, where his friend says, “quoties te Roma tuo refici pro·
perantem reddet Aquino.'’ But this only shows that Juvenal was in
‚the habit of frequenting that town. Persius (S. vi. 7) speaks of thesea
on the Ligurian coast as ‘meum mare,' because he was staying there at
the time, but no one now infers from this, that he was born on thot
coast ⁸. Where Juvenal was born therefore ia uncertain ⁸, and the
time of his birth is equally so.

That he wrote as late aa the reign of Trajan, who succeeded Nerva
aa. 98,’is certain from the allusion iu the first Satira (v. 47), and the
aighth (v. 120) ιο the crimes and baniehment of Marius Priscus, whose
exile took place an. 100.

Another proof is that, in Sat. xii· tt, he refers ιο the inner basin of
the Portus Augusti, constructed by trajan [li Juvenal wrote this
Satira, the conclusion from the text is truc 3 aud if he did not, the passage
still proves that this Satira wae written after Trajan’s port was
constructed]

In Sat. vi. 602, there is an allusion to the way ladies wore their hair,
which seems to show thot this Satira was written in the reign of Trajan,
or early iu that of Hadrian (see note).

In v. 407 of tha same Satine, lipsius traces a reference to the reduc·
tion of Armenia to the condition of a Roman province, by the same
emperor, in au. 106. This argument however has not much force.
