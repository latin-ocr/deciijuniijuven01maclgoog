xiv ι INTRODUCTION.

great crowds, and with great success, several times: so that he was led
to insert in his first writings those verses which he had written first:

‘Quod nou dant proceres dabit histrio: tu Camerinos
Ει Bareas, ιιι nobilium magna atria emas?
Praefectos Pelopea facit, Philomela tribunos ²!

The player was at that time one of the favourites at court, and many of
his supporters were daily promoted. Juvenal, therefore, fell under·
suspicion as one who had covertly censured the times; and forthwith
under colour of military promotion‚ though he was eighty years of age,

he was removed from the city, and sent ιο be praefectus of a cohort -

which was stationed in the furthest part of Egypt. That sort of
punishment was determined upon as being suited to a light and jocular
offence. Within a very short time he died of vexation and diegust.”

The chief points stated in the foregoing life are, that Juvenal was the
son of a rich freedman either by birth or by adoption (for this Ι suppose
the writer means); that he aas a practised rhetorician; that he began
to write satire after middle life; that his first attempt was an epigram
upon Paris the pantomimus⁸3 that he was encouraged by the success of
this production ιο write Satires on a longer scale, which at first he
concealed, but afterwards read them ιο large audiences with great ’
applause ; that whereas he was rash enough ιο introduce in one of his
poems the original epigram (which, as 1 suppose the writer means ιο
imply, so became more public, and probably for the first time reached
'the ears of the person it was aimed at), Paris by his influeuoe at
court obtained his banishment, under the honourable form of a military
’ command, tothe farthest part of Egypt, that he was then eighty years
of age⁴, and that he shortly died of vexation.

Another of these notiees states that Juvenal was born at Aquinum,

· in the reign of Claudius; ·that he returned from exile, survived the v

reign of Trajan, and finally died of old age in a fit of coughing. ¹

In a third we are told that when he returned ιο Rome, finding his
friend Martial was dead, he died of grief in his eighty-second year.

A fourth says it was Domitian who exiled him3 that he never re·
turned, but that af‘ter correcting and adding to his Satires in Egypt, he
died there of old age in the reign of Antoninus Pius.

From a fifth wa learn that he was advanced ιο the equestrian rank

through¹ his own merit3 that the place of his honourable exile was
Scotland, and that the motive was that he might be killed in battle;

² S. vaae, sqq.

³ 'lhough there were two players of this name, ons a favour-ite of Nero, the other of
Domitian, there can be no doubt the writer means Domrtran s man.

⁴ As Paris was put ιο death r..n 83, this would make Juvenal to hoveheen born
about the year oue ofthe Christianam (ιι. 87, noto).
