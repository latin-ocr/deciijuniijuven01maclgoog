SATIRA VIII. 193

Si tenerum attritus Catinensi pumice lumbum
squalentes traducit avos, emptorque veneni
Frangenda miseram funestat imagine gentem?
Tota licet veteres exornent undique cerae ·
Atria, nobilitas sola est atque unica virtus.
Paullus vel Cossus vel Drusus moribus esto;
Hos ante effigies majorum pone tuorum 3
Praecedant ipsas illi te Consule virgas.
