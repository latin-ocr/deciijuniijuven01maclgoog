xviii INTRODUCTION.

Armenia was finally snbdned by Thcjan. In v. 120 ιιο sams Mariua
is referred ιο aa having ‘nuper' stripped the Africana. But ‘nuper' is
used with much latitude, and the name of Marius was long held in
remembrance as the great spoilcr of provinces, having been made more
notorious through the celebrity of Tacitus the historian and Pliny the
younger, who were employed ιο prosecute him, just as the speechcs of
Burke and Sheridan against Warren Hastings have perpetuated and
spread the ill-fame of his Indian govemment.

>It ia certain that the fourth Satire was written after the death of
Domitian, an. 96, since his death is expressly mentioned in the last two
verses. This Satire therefore may be assigned to the reign of Nerva
from September, an. 96, to January, an. 98, or very early in his suc·
cessor Trajan’s reign. The subject would only-amase soon after the
tyrant’s death.

The twelfth Satira, which refers to Trajan’s basin in the Portus
Augusti (v. 75, dcc), must have been written in his reign or after it.
This argument assumes what there is no good reason ιο doubt, that ιιο
Scholisst is right in attributing this work to 'lhnjan '.

According ιο these calculatione eight out of the sixteen Satires were
written after the death of Domitian. The sixteenth is a fragment, and
it may ιο admitted that, if not the last written, it was not begun very
long before the last, whichever that may have been. Thus more than
half the extant Satires were written, as I suppose, between an. 96 and
an. 120, or some of them possibly a little later, s period of at least
¹ twenty-four years. ¹

If any credit is due to the statement of the Grammsrians, in which
they all agree, that Juvenal did not begin to write in this style till he
was near middle life, we may suppose that none of the Satires were
written much before ιιο death of Domitian. We cannot tell how long
the vigorous spirit that appears in all these pocms may last, and show
itself in compositione of this sort. It is no argument to say that Horace
soon got tired of Satira. His mind and circumstances were very diffe-
rent from J uvenal's. But twenty-four years after ιιο periodos middle
life carries a man on to an age when, under almost any circumstances,
ιιο mind loses its frcshness and sseks rest, at least from the excitament
of such compositions; and 1 think Juvenal could not have been more
than forty‚ and probably not so much, when Domitian died. This may
be affirmed whether the Grammarians bave stated the truthon the
above point or not, if my calculatione are not altogether wrong. This

⁹ Cramer (Italy, il. 14) thinks the Scholisst has confonndcd this work with the har·
bour of Centumcellae (civita Vecchis), which was constructcd by 'lhnjan3 but Sir W.

Gall (Rome and its lfrcinity, ii. 1⁷⁶, sqq.) audather scholare entertain no doubt of this
basin too being 'lh-sjsn’s.
