D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Antilochi barbam ardentem ; quum quaerit ab omni, ‘
Quisquis adest socius, cur haec in tempora duret,
Quod facinus dignum tam longo admiserit aevo. 255
Haec eadem Peleus, raptum quum luget Achillem,
’ Atque alius, caifas Ithacum lugere natantem.

Incolumi Troja Priamus venisset ad umbras
Assaraci magnis solemnibus, Hectore funus
Portante ac reliquis fratrum cervicibus inter 260
Iliadum lacrimae, ut primos edere planctus,
Cassandra inciperet scissaque Polyxena palla,

‘ Si foret exstinctus diuerso tempore, quo non
Coeperat audaces Paris aedificare carinas.
Longa dies igitur quid eontulit? omnia vidit 265
Eversa et flammis Asiam ferroque cadentem.
Tunc miles tremulus posita tulit arma tiara
Et ruit ante aram summi J ovis, ut vetulus bos,
Qui domini cultris tenue et miserabile collum
Praebet ab ingrato jam fastiditus aratro. 270
Exitus ille utcunque hominis; sed torva canino
Latravit rictu quae post huno vixerat uxor.
Festino ad nostros et regem transeo Ponti
