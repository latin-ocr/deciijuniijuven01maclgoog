SATIRA Ι.

111 cito rapturus de nobilitate comesa

Quod superest ; quem Massa timet, quem munere palpat 35
Carus et a trepido Thymele summissa Latino 3!

Unciolam Proculeius hahet, sed Gillo deuncem, 40
Partes quisque suas ad mensuram inguinis heres.
Accipiat sane mercedem sanguinis et sic

Palleat ut nudis pressit qui calcibus anguem,
Aut Lugdunensem rhetor dicturus ad aram.
