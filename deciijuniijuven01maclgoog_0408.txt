doe ιιοι ιιιιοιιιιι in my opinion ιο sufficient evidence agrium the authenticity of the
satire. ‘ihs only Mas. from which it is distinctly said ιο be absent arc the two
Copenhagen noticed by Heinrich, who does not mention their eges. What Lubinns
says is only repeated from οιιιιι, whom he does not ιιιιιιι, while if Scaliger really said
ιο Lubinus what he attributes ιο him, hie opinion must be hliowed great weight. If he
did not, ιιοιι Lubinue’ word is worth nothing. 'l'he date of the principa} Scholium is
uncertain, and the observatius it contains makes no reference ιο MS& and though
the Scholium shows thut the satire was hy mauy not thought to be Juvenal’s, it does
not say on what grounds they “exploded '' it. An opinion founded only on the merita
of a work like thie would not be worth more in the third century than now. Ἴ

Τιοι ιιι poem is complete no one can say, whether it be Juvenal's or another's,
and one who had set himself ιο imitate J uvenal, and had the ability ιο do it as well ιιι
this writer, isnot likely ιο ιιιο published a fragment or a composition ιο defective in
order and integrity ιιι this. l do not think with Heinrich that it is begging the question
ιο say it is only a fragment. It seems ιο me impossible to view it in any other light
than that of an unfinished poem, und 1 think it may very well have been a posthumous
publication of Juvenal’s. I cannot otherwise account for its publication at all, for as a
whole it is without point; while newerthelcss it contains some good writing worthy of
J uvenal, and might have been expauded, if the author had finiehed it according ιο his
desigu, into a very amusing entire. Wh0ever the writer was, it is ιο be regretted for
lristorical purposee hadid not iinish his work, for it relntes to a subject, Roman military
life, which is full of interest.

Heinrich is right in saying that ιο judge of the authenticity of a work hy the style
and manner and language is uneafe, that the valne of such jndgment depende on the
capacity of the critic, and that it requires peculiar skill and natural instincte, which are
not common. But iu this instance, where it is not denied by those who think Juvenal
may be the author that the work is ιιοι iu the state in which if he had finished it we
should now have had it, this sort of sagacity ie not wanted. The satire is in a con·
dition in which ιιο author of so much capacity would have given it ιο the world who
wished ιο gain reputation hy it, and no author of reputation would have published it in
bie lifetime, though he might have made it known ιο hn friends. The person who
wrote v. 7 (which Heinrich rejects without good reason) must have intended to write
more on the subject that verse introduces 5 and he who should bring in a single mam·
ple by au exordium plainly intended for several and not see that he was bungliug, could
never have written the verses in which that example is eet forth.

ldo not think then there is sufficient resson for supposing the fragment spurious, or
the parlial rejection of it iu early times ιο heve proceeded from any other cause than its
imperfect character. .

The satire is in the form of an epistie like the laet, and it professes ιο set forth the
advantages of a military life, looking st it ιιι a young meu might when tired uf a
civiliau’s restraints. Of these advantages the writer instances the liberty of the soldier
ιο ιιιιιιΙιι civilian without any fear of an action for damagea, for the soldier can only
be tried in cramp. and if a townsmen comes there for redress hc may get a rude sort of
justice hom a court-martial. butthe whole cumpwili make him rue bis revenge. 'lben
justice in civil courts is attended with many delays, while in the camp it is prompt
aud decisivo. Besidss which a father has no power over his eou's military earnings, and
the soldier can make a will of bis own.

'l'his is literally the whole of the satire. It is aa much a satire upon thecamp aethe
town, aud so probably it would have been carried out in a variety of compar-isone
between the soldier and civilian. Assuming Juvenal to bs the author of the satire we
need not imagine (ae the old commentatore did) any particular circumstances having
given risa ιο it. ‘l'he subject is one that might have suggested itself ιο any 0110, aud
