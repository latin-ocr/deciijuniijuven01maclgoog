LIFE OF PERSIUS. xxv

He reverenced as a father Servilius Nonianus. Through Cornutus 16
made the acquaintance 61 Annaeus Lucanus lilrewise‘, who was 611116
own age and a disciple of Cornutus, Now Cornutus was a tragic writer
6111161 day', of the Stoic sect, and he left behind him books 61 philo·
sophy. Lucanus so admired the writings 61 Flaccus, that while he was
reciting he could scarcely refrain from crying 6111 [and saying that this
was true poetry]⁸. He became acquainted with 8616666166,1616111
life, but 1161 66 as to be taken by his character. He enjoyed in Cornu· ,
tus’ house the society 61 two 111661 learned men 61 very holy 11166, 61
1161 111116 earnestly engaged in philosophy, namely‚ Claudius Agathe-
merus, a physician 61 Lacedaemon, and Petronius Aristocrates 61
Magnesia, whom above 611 611616 16 admired and emulated, 161 they
were his contemporaries and disciples 61 Cornutus ⁹. He was also 161
nearly ten years greatly beloved by Paetus Thrasea, and travelled
with him sometimes, Τ1116666 having married Persius' kinswomau Arria.
Hc was 6 11161161 111661 gentle manners, 61 maidenly modesty, 611161111-
some form, and a pattern 61 piety towards his mother, and sister, and
aunt. He was discreet and chaste. He left about two million
sesterces to his mother and sister, and only wrote 6 11616 16 his mother,
aslring her 16 give Cornutus a hundred thousand sesterces, as some say,
but as others will have it, twenty pounds' weight 61 wrought silver, and
about seven hundred 1611111166 61 Chrysippus, or 611 116 library ¹. But
Cornutus took the books and left 1116 money for his mother and sister,
whom he had made his heirs ¹. Η6 wrote seldom and slowly. This
very book he left unfinished. Some verses 11616 been taken from the
end of 1116116611, 11161 11 might seem finished. Cornutus made some
trifling corrections; and when Caesius Bassus asked that he might him-
self be allowed 16 edit it, he gave it him for that purpose. Flaccus also
in his boyhood had written 6 comedy called Restio ⁸, and 6116 book 61

⁶ By ‘Annaeum etism Lucanum’ he means Lucanus, who was also 6116 611116 Annaei,
66 Cornutus himself was.

⁷ ‘Meus’ 1116 reading 61 all the 1188, is 111661 probably corrupt.

⁸ “Quin illa 66661616 poemata diecret.'' These words are no doubt an interpolation.
Heinrich thinks 1116 interpolator had in mind the modest language 61 Persius in the
Prologus. '

⁹ ‘Cornuti minores! 'lhe common reading is ‘Cornuto' Agathemerus’ name is
311611 as Agatcrnus in the MSS. See below.

¹ 'l'his should be ‘or as soma say.' but the text is defective. (Heinrich.) As 161116
boolrs 61 Chrysippus, ses Introduction 16 8. 1. ,

¹''l'he MSS. bave ‘⁸ pecuniam sororibus quas 116161· heredes fecerat reliquit? which
contradicts what 1166 just been said. ‘ Frater’ was added when the first mistalre, ‘sorori-
bus' was made. »

⁸ 1116 1188. have Vescia. Heinrich changes this 16 Restio, 1116 Ropemalrer, which
was thetitle 616116 61 Laberius’ 1111666.
