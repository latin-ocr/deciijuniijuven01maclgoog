188 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

’ serien vui.

INTRODUOTION.

'lna viee of aristocratic protensiori is here represented with moderatiori and good sense.
'I'here is ne idle declamation against hereditary honours, but the blindness of rnen
belonging ιο an exclusive class, whose claime ιο distinction were founded upon the
merita of the great aud guod of former generations and uusupported by any persoual
merite of their own, is shown in lauguage which ne one ean object te, aud reasoning
which admits of no answer. The nobilityvof amau's encastum, he says, only holds a
torch up ιο his shame if he live unworthily of them. The more exalted isthe guilty,
themora conspicuous 'rs his guilt. The only true uobility is νὶοιοο, aud the virtuous
nobleman is a noblcmau indeed. The raca-horse, if he show no signs of his desceut, ia
set to grind er draw a eart. Among the despised plebeians there are those who have
great gifta aud virtues, and have rendered great services te the uobility and to their
country. These are the eommeuplaoes ef the Satira, which also expows some of the
particular vices among the patricianaof the day, among which were gnmhling, keeping
low company at taverna, a passion for dridug and for the stables, acting in public,
hiring themselves for gladiatore ; but ,above all gross maladministration in the

provinces, against which Juvenal takes psius ιο cantion his friend, Ponticus, ιο whom
the Satira is addressed in the form ef an Epistle. He is one of the class against
whose degenerante members the Satire is directcd; and we may suppose ιο was a
young man with what we should call good prospecta. I think a real person must

have been meant, and that the poem is not a mere declamatiou. Heinrich inquires
whether the subJ‘eet was suggested by real life or the rhetorical schools‚ and thinks
the poem was drawn from both sources. There was enough iu real life to suggest
it, as there would be still and perhaps mere; and we need not,I think, go ιο ιιο
scheols for its inspiratien. The pride of birth and the degeneracy ef iuherited nobility
were not new features of society in Juvenal's time, aud they have not grown so old
in onrs but that generations to come will complain es he did, and pour contempt,
as he did not, en the inheritauee of noble names, however virtuous their possessura
may ιο.

'lbere are some severe lines ou the Emperor Nero (an-226), and the Satira was
written after his time, as the context shows ; but how long it is impossible to say.

ARGUMENT.

What use are pedigreea, ancestral blood,¹ statues and inunges, sud noble names, if in
the face of eur great ancestors we live amisa-gambling all night and going to bed
at dawu, when they were up and marchiug? What joy has Fabius of eho·
Allobroges’ victer, of the great altar, of his descent frum Hercules, if he ιο covetous
a feel, effeminate, if hc bring shame ou his rough ancestors, turu poiaouer, and
diagraee his house? Line your whole house with images, yet still virtue alenc is true
nobility. Be Paullus, Cossus, Drusus iu your merals, and give them place before your
images, ay, and your own lictors ιοο. First I claim the goodness ef your beart: be
hely, just, in word and deed, aud theu 1 count you noble. Hail, Gaetulicus, er what·
soever stock yon come from, your country may be prend of you, and all may cry as
they do who have found Osiris. What man is genereus if he be unworthy of his
racc, illustrious only for bis name? We eall a dwarf au Atlas, au Aethiops swan,
