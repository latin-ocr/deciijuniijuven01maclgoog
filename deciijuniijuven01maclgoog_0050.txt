a great respect for, says itienot ao much contire ιι s prefuoe orintroductionto s volume
of astirea. It ia certainlys setire ιι severe ιι any in the book. Juvenal hsdprobcbly
written others before it, bnt Ido not ιιι enough in this poem to entitle it to ιι called a
preface. He snys sll the pamions of men from tho flood dowuwnrds arethe hodge· podge ,
of his book-“ nostri farrago libelli'' (v.) 86) -and he ιιι touched upon egood menyof q
them ιι thia satire, which moy bc the‘ libellua' ιι menna. lf not, he muat huve been' ’
intendingto publiah scollection3 for‘ libellus' must mean something definite, either one

J poem or s collection. He begins with suppoeing himself persuaded by some poraon not

l to write, ιι Ηοιιιι pretends with 'li-obatiue (S.ii. 1). But the timea are such, heroys,

¹ that ιι cannot help it 3 und while there ere so rnany indifferent poete sponting their linea
every where, ιι may aa well write onothera. He then goes into a detail of some of tho
vile features of society 3 among which ιιι the voluntary degradation os women 3 their
lewdneee3 the preferment of slnvea and informer-s 3 the impunity of robbers, and forgcra.

about the poeta and their recitatione ιι only a way of introducing humoronsly the graver
matters thut follow. Agood deul os whot wau recited was no doubt bed enough, but
Juvenal' s quurrel was not with his literary brethrcn, whoee csuache takes up, ιι well
ιι their recitationes ιιι the seventh satire. They have ιιι reality nothing to do with the
satire ιι such ,though J nvenal pretends they hove. Τιι argumenta prefixed to the MSS.
trent this satiro aa a prefnoe to the rest. Ruperti, on the other hond, thinks it wns
written before all the others, ond Dryden that it ιι “the natural groundwoyk of all the ι
rest;'' for ‘⁴ ιιιιὶιι ιι confines himselfto no οιιι subject, but atrikes indifferently nt

the other. It might heve been written firat or lustfor any evidence Icen find in the poem
itaelf, irrespective of the sign of the dntcnoticed above, which puts it luter perhaps then
some. ’
