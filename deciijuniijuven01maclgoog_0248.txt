Exspectata diu tandem provincia quum te
Rectorem accipiet, pone irae fraena modumque,
Pone et avaritiae, miserere inopum sociorum3
Ossa vides regum vacuis exsucta medullis. '90
Respice quid moneant leges, quid curia mandet,
Praemia quanta bonos maneant, quam fulmine justo
, Et Capito et Numitor ruerint damnante Senatu,
Piratae Cilicum. Sed quid damnatio confert,
Quum Pansa eripiat quidquid tibi Natta reliquit? 95
Praeconem, Chaerippe‚ tuis circumspice pannis,
Jamque tace: furor est post omnia perdere naulum.
Non idem gemitus olim neque vulnus erat par
Damnorum sociis florentibus et modo victis.
Plena domus tunc omnis, et ingens stabat acervus 100
