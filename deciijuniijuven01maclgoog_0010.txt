“ PREFACE.

As in the case of Horace, there has been cossated a sufficient num·
ber of good MSS. of Juvenal to supply a satisfactory text without
resorting to conjecture, and I believe there is authority from MSS.
cr scholia for all the readings I have adopted. That MS. to which
most weight is, perhaps deservedly, attached is commonly called
the Codex Eudemia, having been originally in the royal library at
Buda, in Hungary. Where it is now, is unknown. It is referred

towards the end of the sixteenth century, our knowledge of it
chiefly depends. It had before been used with less care by Valla,
whose edition was first published at Venice acentury earlier (1486).

Phom this MS. copious scholia were published by these editors,
and they are referred to generally as ‘ the Scholiast' in this and
other editions. But they are not all from the same hand. They
have been carefully edited by Heinrich and Schopen, and still
more so by Cramer (Hamburg, 1823), who found a MS. at St.
Gallen, in Switzerland, containing the same, or nearly the same
scholia astho MS. of Buda. Cramer assigna the St. Gallen MS.

Otto Jahn (Berlin, 1851) and C. F. Hermann (Leipzig, 1854),
who says (Prefaoe, p. 19) that it alone represents the genuine text
of Juvenal, the others being derived from a text “multiplici veteris
correctoris licentia deformatum.’' I look upon this as a rash
