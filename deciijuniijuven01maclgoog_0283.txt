284 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Exstantem, et medio subliuacm in puluere Circi
In tunica J ovis, et pictae Sarrana ferentem

Ex humeris aulaea togae, magnaeque coronae
'lantum orbern quanto cervix non sufficit ulla? 40

Quippe tenet sudans hanc publicus et, sibi Consul
Ne placeat, curru servus portatur eodem.
Da nunc st volucrem sceptro quae surgit eburno,
Illinc cornicines, hinc praecedentia longi
Agminis officia, et niveos ad fraena Quirites 45
’ Defessa in loculis quos sportula fecit amicos. ’
. 'lium quoque materiam risus invenit ad omnes
, Occursus hominum, cujus prudentia monstrat
Summos posse viros et magua exempla daturos
Vervecum in patria crassoque sub aere nasci. 50
Ridebat 'curas nec non et gaudia vulgi,

Interdum et lacrimas, quum Fortunae ipse minaci
Mandaret laqueum mediumque ostenderet unguem.

Ergo supervacu'p autlpernicitsa petuntur,
Propter quaa fas est genua incerare deorum. 55
