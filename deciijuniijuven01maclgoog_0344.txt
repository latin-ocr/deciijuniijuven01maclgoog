SATIRA XIII. 295

Hos quoque felices qui ferre incommoda vitae

f Nec jactare jugum vitu didicere magistra.
Quae tam festa dies ut cesset prodere furem,
Perfidiam, fraudes, atque omni ex crimine lucrum
Quaesitum, et partos gladio vel pyxide nummos? 25
Rari quippe boni: numerus vix est totidem quot
Thebarum portae vel divitis ostia Nili.
Nona aetas agitur pejoraque secula ferri
Temporibus, quorum sceleri non invenit ipsa
Nomen et a nullo posuit ustura metallo. 30
