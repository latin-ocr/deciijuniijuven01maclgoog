birthplace. Iam 1 101 01 Cecrops ! ” Long may you live to enjoy your birth! But
in that low rabble you will flnd a msn 01 eloquence, who shall defend 10110 noble

all Cecropian, sa useless aa a Hermen the only difference is his head’s 01 marble,
ycurs has 1110 in it. Tell me‚0 Trojan, who eounta animula noble except they're
hravei We praise a horse 101 apeed who has wcn many races easily. When-ever he
was reared we call him noble who beata the rest, while a mere herd 10 10 put up and
sold are the best bred 11 11ογ 111 aeldom wia. There we harenc respect 101
succatry: they 1011 101 111110 and go 10 draw acart 01 grind a mill. So tell me sorne-
thing 01 your own tc engrave upon your bust, besides the honours that we 11001γ

V. 71. Encugh 101 him, who lacking common sense (rare in that 11110 01 life) is pnffed
with his relationship tc Nero. But you, my friend, 1 would not have you valued

judge, witness inflexible, count not your 1110 before your character, your 1110 before
the cause for which γοα live. 'l'hat man deservea 10 die, though 101110 sumptuously

V. 87. When you have got the province that you 10011 101, put reins upon your temper
and desires ; pity 110 100111111οη 110 princes yon will see have all the marrow

honours that aweit the good, 110 fate 01 those who were condemned 101 robbing the
Ciliciam. Not thatsueh condemnatiou is worth much, when cuc takes what another
leaves. (10, get 11 1111101001 10 sell your clothes, Chaerippus, aad straight say

tc me, you who forge wills in temples which your grandsire built, hetore your father's
statue, and ateal by night 1ο an adultercus bed?

V. 117. Fat couspl Lateranus drives his cocch right past the sabea 01111 sires by night,
but the moon and stars look on, and when his consulship ia done he'll do itin broad ,
day and meet his aged friend without a blush. He’ll do grooms' work, and when he
goes to sacrifice 10 J cve he'll swear by Epona aud stable gods. And when he goes to
