D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Unde nefas tantum Latiis pastoribus? unde

Haec tetigit, Gradive, tuos urtica nepotes?

Traditur ecce viro clarus genere atque opibus vir:

Nec galeam quassas, nec terram cuspide pulsas, - 110
Νο0 quereris patri? Vade ergo et cede severi

Jugeribus campi quern negligis l “Officium cras

Primo sole mihi peragendum in valle Quirini.”

Quae causa officii? “ Quid quaeris? Nubit amicus,
Nec multos adhibet.’' Liceat modo vivere, fient, 135
Fient ista palam cupient et in acta referri.

Interea tormentum ingens nubentibus haeret

Quod nequeunt parere et partu retinere maritos.
