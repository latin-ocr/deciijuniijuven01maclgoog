SATIRA VIII. 203

Tunc lieet a Pico numeres genus, altaque si te

Nomina delectant, omnem Titanida pugnam

Nobilitas claramque facem praeferre pudendis.

Crimen habet, quanto major qui peccat habetur.

Quo mihi te solitum falsas signare tabellas

ln templis quae fecit avus statuamque parentis

Ante triumphalem? quo si nocturnus adulter

Tempora Santonico velas adoperta cucullo? 145
