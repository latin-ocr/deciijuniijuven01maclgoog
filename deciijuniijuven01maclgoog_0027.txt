Of Juvenal's personui character it is not so easy 1ο 161111 au estimate
from his writings as it is of Horace’s. That his invectivas against 1116
11666 61 his timeare not the mere artistic and declamatory compositione
which some writers suppose them 16 be, but the 1111116 61 an honest
indignation, of rare powers of sarcasm, and 616 large knowledge 61 the
world, I think is manifest. His lauguage is unreserved in dealing with
1116 16111661 11666, but there is no appearance of his being himself a loose
11161 111 any part 61 his aritings. When Horace is course 116 betrays
something of sympathy with 1166, while J 6161161 shows only contempt
for it. Although therefore an expurgated edition of duvenal would
have more gaps than an expurgated edition 61 Η61666, 6 well-regulated
mind would be less offended with the entire text of J uvenal than with
that of Horace. duvenal’s morality was of a higher and less technical
sort than Horace’s, and has led some into the notion that he drew it
from the purest source, and was in understanding, if 1161 by profession,
a Christian. This 61 course is absurd. He knew human nature, aud
116 knew right from wrong, and was not blinded by seh-indulgence, and
so was able 16 61616 the law of conscience in a way 16 astonish some
Christiane, to whom that law is very imperfcetly known.

Apart from his morality duvenal was a great master 61 words, and
had 6 large fund 61 illustration. His picturus drawn from real life, 66 1 “
have observed in the course of the 116166, 616 particularly happy: whether
they represent the common room 6161616111, 61 the deck 61 6 ship, 61
the inside 61 6 soldier's hut 6161 6 campora schoolroom, or the greedy
crowd at the sportula, 61 the 6116616 61 Rome, or a druuken brawl, these
and a hundred 611161 6661166 616 66 drawn that an artist would have no
difficulty in transferring them toeanras. But his hand must be vigorous
and his brush free, 61 he would de 116 justice to Juvenal.

There is one particular form of lust from which modern wickedness
shrinks, but which was one 61 the worst evils of Roman society under
the Empire. This 1166 16 exposed in two Satires of great power (ii. 116).
The wickedness 61 women was never so unsparingly handled 66 11 16 in
the sixth 86111666616666111611616111166111111611 power and variety. The
general degradation of Roman life and manners 16 exposed in the fust,
third, and fourteenth Satires, and in the last ef these the chief cause of
the universal wickedness is laid open in the indifference of parents to
the morals of their young children, and the example which hauded down
rice 66 611 inheritance from father to sou. The degradation of the
Senate, once the fountain of honour and authority, and the proudest
