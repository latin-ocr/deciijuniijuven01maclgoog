PREFACE. xi

Ι ‘have not thought it right to omit any part of these Satires.
'The character of the writers is seen throughout, and the spirit even
of the coarsest parts is manifestly that of virtue. Ι have had some
experience of hoya, and Ι believe that those are exceptione on ·
whom such passages as are usually expunged are likely to have an
injurious effect. Wantonness is one thing, and the stern reproof
of wantonness in terma it best understands is another, and few
minda fail to see the differenoe. I have thought it enough to pass
over the worst passages without comment.

He who is occupied with the labours of two professione, the cares
of a large ¹family, and the unavoidable distinctions of atown life,
may claim some indulgence for the defecto of a work requiring much
attention and a clear judgment at every point, and for the execution
of which only a hmited time could be allowed. Ι have done
the best-I could under the circumstances l'or studento and general
readers of Juvenal and Persius, that they may be ableto understand
and take an interest in those writers, especially the former, who has
great charms for all that can appreciate a vigorous mind and Stoical

integrity. Iu this task Ι am thanlrful to have had the advice and
sympathy of my friend, Mr. George Long.
