SATIRA Χ.

rnrnonuc'sson.

honen thie satire takes general ground, the subject it treats of ie brought horne by
examples and the mode of treatment to the generation in which it was written. In
this respect ar well as in caustic power, in brilliancy ot‘ language, in variety aa well as
originality‚ itis superior tc the poem written in imitation of it by Dr. Johnson, and
through which it ia bart known to the majority ot English readers. 'l'he graphio and
dramatic perage onthe fortunas of Quum irtamely represented by the corresponding ’
example ot* wne„ and the description of charles of Sweden is a berry snbatitute for ’ ’
that of Hannibal. No description of an imbecile old age evercania near that which is
contained in this satire, and the picturas or* Prism’s death aa it might have hoen and ss
it was are soenes which might he transferred to canras. 'lhe langurga of Nestor at
bis son's funeral ia very monmt'ul. The serious lines at the end, though the thoughts
they contain are not all original, are in Juvenal's beat style, which is better than
llorere's iu dealing with grave subjecte in serious langnngn, as it is the style or* e men
in earneat, rn impression which Juvenal always conreyr, bnt Horace seldom. 'l'ho
relation ol men to God is trnly ststffl in the worda ‘Carior est illis homo qnam sibi 3⁸¹
and the rigonr ot* a manly beart is excellently described in half a (lezen lines, ‘Fortem
posce animum? lic.

The subject ot the satire is the vanity of human wishes, which ere seldom conceived
