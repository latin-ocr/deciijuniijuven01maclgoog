SATIRA III.

Viscera magnarum domuum dominique futuri.
'‘Ingenium velox, audacia perdita, sermo

Promptus et Isaeo torrentior. Ede quid iilum

Esse putes? quem vis hominem secum attulit ad nos : 75

Grammaticus, rhetor, geometres, pictor, alipteS,

Augur, schoenobates, medicus, magus: omnia novit.

Graeculus esuriens in caelum jusseris ibit.

Ad summam, hon Maurus erat neque Sarmata nec Thrax

Qui sumpsit pennas, mediis sed natus Athenis* ιο t

Horum ego non fugiam conchylia? me prior ille

Signabit? fultusque toro meliore recumbet

Advectus Romam quo pruna et cottona vento?
