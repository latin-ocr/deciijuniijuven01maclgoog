SATIRA vi.

INTRODUCTION.
'l'nrs vigorous and wonderfully copions satire is written in the form oi au epietle to ο

“ person nomed Postumus Umidius, who is aconito be married' 'lhe poet remonstretes

with him upon so mod e prooeeding, und takes ooceuion ιο represent the vices end sullies
oi women in such colonrs and under such c variety oi forms, ss might well stcgger s mon
who intended to take u wile irum that generetiou, end appel one who, us he supposes
may bethe cose with his iriendbhcd slreody committed himself ιο that false step But
the friend is eu imaginor-y person, aud only furnishes the handle for such severe trent·
mentes the sex hus never suffered before or since. 'lhe genersl truth oi the picture
Juvenal drcws is sufficiently attested by other writers, end moy be inserted from the
honeet ond genuine tone oi the satire itself. Juvenal's was the heroic ege of semele
corruption : there were giants civice iu those days, es there were oi pession and exslted
tenderness in the times oi fsble end tradition. hiesselline was ιο wentonness whst
Medea vens ιο outraged love, end Antigone to awomen's seli-devotiou; the difference
being that these were the erectione of en exquisite imagination eud the embodying oi
a poet's ideal, while the other went beyond cll thot imagination could have eonceived or
poete would have venturcd ιο ieign iu the realities of u womun's duily lieentiousness.
‘l'he nature of the exemplet Juvenal chooses und the extravagant characteres the
times he lived in limit the application oi the worst perte oi this satire almost ιο ono
generation. Though all eges οι· rsdncment produce semele vice end werhness in ebun-
dnuee, it moy be hoped ii J nvenal bad lived ιο expone modern women to themselves and
to the world, he would, even in the worst days of their dobnucbery and folly, heve taken
different ground, and pointed his characters in lesu superhumnn proportions; though
Dryden, by apologizing ιο the lsdies his contemporaries ior translating the satire, leaves
the impressiou thet it is not without its upplioetion ιο them. 'lhe chief interest oi the
poem lies in the great powers oi longuege und uneompromising force oi iudigmtion thet
it disploys, and in the historical picture it contains oi the munnere oi the times.
Adultery is the vice with which the poem opens. lt is said ιο have existed before nil
others, ind to heve begun when the simplieity of savege life, with its rude heodem from
temptation, geve placeto the rcflnemente oi civilized society. The increase oi weelth
nnd the introduction os ioreign manners through the conquesto oi Rome, end the' idleness .
of peace, ure the causes ιο which Juvenal attributes, iu eommou with others, the
deterioretion oi morale and the graduul growth of those stupendous vices that he
describes. Bastern impostures und Greek debuuehery very quietly took root in the
soil oi llome, sud brought forth the fruita oi n rampant superstition and proiligucy,
