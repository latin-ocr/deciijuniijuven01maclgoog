considered the best. Ι have not made the collation myself‚ but Ihave
examined it and l hope it is sufficient. This collation does not show
the differences in orthography, where the words are the same, nor the
differences in punctuation except in some cases where these differences
effect the sense. Ι have examined all the passages in which these two
texts differ, and I find a great many iu which Macleane’s text is better
than that 61 Jahn, who has introduced semebad readings. I have
observed 6 few passages in which Ι should prefer Jahu's text, but on
the whole Ι think the Englishman has shown more good sense and
jndgment than the German.

I have added in the notes nearly all the variatione of Ribbeck's text.
Many of Ribbeck's variatione arethe same as Jahn’s, but he has some of
his own, and most of them seem to me bad. Some of his transpositione
improve the text, but most of them do not. He has handled the sixth
Satire so freely as to the transposition and omission ,of verses, that ς
11 would require much time and study to pass a just judgment on his
labour; but it will be generally allowed that the matter of this Satire,
as it stands in the common texts, is not well arranged. ’

I have 1116116 many small corrections in Mr. Macleane's notes, where
there was some slight 6116161 11116-616161116111, bnt Ι have omitted nothing
’ and altered nothing which Ι believe the editor would not have omitted
orcorrected. He would probably have changed his opinionon some
points, and would both have omitted and altered much more than Ι have
done, 161 my business was not to edit Juvenal and Persius, but to pre·
serve the work of my friend. The references in this volume 616 very
numerous, and the causes of errors in the figures of euch references are
various. I have corrected a great many wrong references, and though
I cannot hope that Ι have corrected all, Ι believe that the errors which
remain are not many. In the references to the MSS. I have discovered
a few slight errore since this hook was printed, but they are not euch 66

and there, where Ι thought it necessary. All the additions which
Ι have made are marked thus [ ].

Ribbeck has published an essayonJuvenel(“Der Echte und derUnechte
Juvenal, Berlin,’' 1865), which is to some extent 6 justification of his
text. After briefly stating how much we leam from Juvenal of Roman
manners from the time of Tiberius to Trajan and Hadrian, he adds that
this knowledge is got exclusively from the first nine Satires and the
eleventh3 that the tenth, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
supply scarcely any information of the kind. They contain mere allu-
sione to well-known names and persons, or introduce characters of
various kinds, which 6161161 marked by any individuality. The genuine

Juvenal is 6 16116161 61 Lucilius, and though he did not lash his con-
