among us? And theu he wants a wife of the old stamp! Bleed him, ye doctore.
Δ pretty fellow! Go give a cols lo Juno il' your wife is chasse: there are but few
can touch the crowns of Ceres, few whom their fathers would uot loathe to kisa.
Well, go and wreathe the tlowers about your door; your wile will with one husband
be conteut,-uay sooner with one eya. We’ve heard, to be sure, of one who lived
chaste at her father¹s country-placa. But let her live so in the country-town: or 1
grant you at her father’s seat ; but who cau tell what goes ou therei Are Jupiter
and Mars so old?

V. 60. In all the porticoes end theatrcs can you see one whom it were sale to wed? See
how they melt at the lasciviens dance, and catch each sigh aud learn it! Others
when theatres are closed get up their private plays. One likea thefaroeplaycr,
one the comic, one the tragic actor, another spoils the singer's voice. What, do yon
think any would lore Quintilian? You marry that muriciam may beget your
children, or your habe may show the face ol' tha mirmillo in his own. Hippia, the
senator's wife, went off tc Egypt witha playa, and e'en Canopus cried shame on our
morale. Forgetful of her home, the wretch, and country, ber spouse, her sister, and
hcr sous, yea even gamas aud Paris she abandoned. Nurtured in luxury, she
despised the sca; her character she had despiscd before—a triding loss among these
meltiugdames. l'es, she bore the dangers of so many seas; but when ’tis duty calls
them, theu they tremble. They're bold enough l'or sin, but if their husbands bid them
go on board, 'tis hard; such nasty smells, they're sich, the alies go round—their
stomach's strong enough when ’tis their paramours they follow. One vomite on ber
husband, while the other dines with the sailors, wauders about the decl, and pulls
the ropes. What was it charmed our Hippia so, that sbc could bear lo be calleda
player's wile? Sergiolus was no boy, his face was ugly, his forebead scarred, a wen
upon his nose, his eye l'or ever dropping. But be was a gladiatam this was his
beauty,'twaaior this she gave up all. They love the steel: let Sergius talio the rudis,
and he's uo better than her husband.

V. lla Why care for private bouseai' Lools at the rivale of our gods, and hear wbat
Claudius bad to bear. llis stmmpet wife stole from bis bed, covered her head, and
with one slave girl went aud tools her stand by the brotbel door, exposed ber person,
told ber price, and took whoever came, aad only when the time came round that she
must go.

V. 1³3. Why should I spealr of cbarms, philtres, aud poisoned step-children? When
their sex's maduess drives them, lust is their smallest fault.

V. 186. But wby's Caesennia virtuous, by ber husband's showing? She brought him a
round aum, that’s what histestimony's worth: 'twas not the bow or torch ol* love that
wou him, ber money is tho torch, ber dos tbe arrows. He buya what liberty he bas ;
the greedy man’s rich wife is as a maid; before his face she node and writes to ber
lover. Why does Sertorius love Bibule? Because she's pretty. Three wriukles, a
black tooth, a drier skiu, and then, “ Pacls up your baggage and begone‚’' he crica ;
“ I’rn tired of you, besides you wipe yournose. Od' with you! tbera's another coming
with dry uose.” 'llll then she’s a hot tyrant; aske for the lineat wools and wines-
nay that's but little-whole prisona full of slaves. malevorum be had she buys;

V. 161. Butos so many is there not one good? Lct her have beauty, grace, weslth,
