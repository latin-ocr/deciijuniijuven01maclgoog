SATIRA XIII. 291

force οι ιιι most weighty sautlmeuts is broken by an οιιιιιιιίιι οι ert, unssmcnabla
learning, and {rigid declamation, particularly iu those parts which speek of the multitude
of criminals every ιι] produces (ιιι, sqq.), the multitude ct gods (r. 40, sqq), the pro· ¹
digies ιο which honesty is likened (r. 62, sqq.), end ιιι doctriua oi the philosopher:
(r. 120, sqq.). The render will judge for himself whether there is any thing frigid in
these pessnges, or more artifieiel then every composition of the kind must be. He says
v. 120, sqq.is ιι unpleasent repetition of r. 19, sqq, and r. 126, sqq. os v. ιιι, sqq.; ιιιι
ιιι order of the orgumeut is interrupted, as lor instance by ιιι story of Glaucus
(r. len-208), which is denied in my note ς ιιι by the solilcqny, which ooenrrsd ιο
tho writer after he had described the shnmelassness of a perjuret, but which his critic
thinks he should have reserred for ι luter place, mistnking the course of the argument
altogether, though lt may be admitted that there Is no '‘ostentation of ert '' in the
arrangement of tha poem, which ιι it prufesses ιο ιι a latter to a friend, sud not
⁸· trigid declamation,'’ is not nnnatural. Ha also churges the satire with repetitidu, and
it ιιι] ιι allowed that there is e summsry uf ιιι argument in the first few lines which
lsusterwards ampliflad in its severul perte. I suppose Jnrennl thought it would ιι ns
well ιο state his doctrine sud enlsrge upon it stherwnrds. Others will think so ιιο.
Ile ιιι delivered ι discourse which the world heve neser ιιιιιι ιο sdmirs, and of which,

ln spite of the blemishes he thinks ιι ιιι found, Ruperti ιιιι it is ·‘ Satin egregin et ,

plena salis sententiarumque grarissimernm.”
From v. 17 it is commonlyinferrad that ιιι poem waswritteuin Hudrinn’s reign, ιιοιι

Bad acts displease the doers. Conscience convicte them though ιιι praetor's nrn be
false. All your friends feel with you ; you ere ιοι ιο poor ιιιι you should sink with
such a loss; besides ιιι cnse is common, ιιι out of sortune’s henp. Put offencessire
grief, the sorrow ιιι man should not blnzc up ιοο high, the pain should ιιι begreatcr
than the ivound. A triflc, emere scrap ot ill you scarce ιιι beer, and all your entrnils
burn because ι friend will ιοι gire up ι deponit, ιιι you nmen ol sixtyl Has not
experieuce taught yon? Wrsdom is great, mistress of fortune: those weoount happy
ιοο whom life has taught ιο bear the yoke ol lire.

V. 23. No day so ιιι] ιιι it puta forth thieves ιιι liars. The good are rnre, not

oi gods ιιι men ιι loudly ns the cliente of Faesidins when ιι pleads. ”

V. 83. Say, nrt thou in thy second childhood that thou knowest not the chnrmsof other
psople's money, or how they leugh ιι your simplicity, expocting ιι] men should

the golden age thought ιο, before the skies were filled so full of gods and hell so full ot'
victims. 'I'hen was dishonesty ι prodigy. ''I'wos a great crime ir youth rose not ιο
age, gen children ιο their seniore hy four years. But now is friends should not deny

were.

V. 71. Complain that you're been impinnsly ιιιιιιι οι ιιι sestertia! Whnt ill tell
