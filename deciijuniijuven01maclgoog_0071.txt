D. JUNII JUVENALIS

SATIRA ΙΙ.

INTRODUCTION.

Tms satire is lavelled at those persons in the upper rauks of society (aud particularly
it would seem at the Emperor Domitian) who, pretendiag a stoica] virtue and crying
out against vice and calling up stringent old lawa against it, were themselves practising
the worst vices in secret, and giving to the agea character which never had been aqualled,
and could never be sur-passed, for debauchery of the filthiest kind. 'I'he Commentators
have generally supposed the Satira to be aimed attha professional philosopham of
the day. “The poet in this Satyr inveighs against the Hypocrisie of tha Philosophers
and Pnests of his time,” is Tate’s account of the argument. What his notione of a
Romm priest may have been it is haul to say, but he writes:

“When hypocrites read lectores, aad a sot,
Because into a (down and Pulpit got,
'l'ho' surfeit-gorged and reelsing from the Stews,
Nothing but Abstincnce for's theme will chuse.'’

Heinrich, in edissertation of much sagacity, has shown that J avenal's meaning is very
different from this, sud the scopa of the poem more wide and important. 'lhe vices and
hypocrisy of Domitian were imitated by the respectable pcople, and at these he airus his
invectives.

From the word ‘nuper' in v. 29, it has been inferred that the satira was written soon
after the events there referred to, which toolr place arn. 83. ‘Nuper' admits a good
deal ot' latitada, as it osten does iu Cicero, but it is reasonable to suppose that Juvenal
wrote while tha matter was pretty fresh, aud as the satire clearly has reference to the
time of Domitian, that it was written before his reign was over. Domitian was
assuminated in September, aaa. 96. It is not very likely that ha gava it much
publicity while the tyrant was alive.

For indignant power there is none of the poema that excels this. 'l'he natura of the
subjecta however readers it almost aaroadable, and nothing but the honesty of tha
writer could malsc the tasls of editing ir endurable. Whoever would judge of the ¹
difference between the spirit of true indignation and that of a wealr or impure mind iu -
dealing with such painful subjecta, should compare Juvenal with his translator Tate,
who has taken from the satire the best recommendation it has, which is the virtue of
the author. If the psalm-translator and poet-laureata was a ulan of purity, he has done
himself injustius. The other tramlators have erecuted their task better in this respect.

ARGUMENT.

I would gladly run to the atmost North when canting hypocrites dara talk of moruls, ,
mere ignorant fellows, though they fill their shelves with busts. N o faith is in their
oatside. The whole town is tecming with these solemn villaina. What, yon reprove
vice, the foulest of all foul pretenders! Tbey effect few worda, and silence, and
cropped hair 3 more honest furis Peribomius, who makes no secret of his sin. 1 leave
him to his destiuy3 I pity him. But they are worst who with tino words attach such
vices. “lam uo worse than you,” says Varillus the degradcd. Iret the straight·
limbcd laugh at the bandy leggcd, tha fair at the blackamoor. For who would tolerate
the Gracchi complaining of sedition, nor exclaim if Verres should effect to hate a thief,
Milo a murdercr, Clodius an adulterer, Catilina Cethegus, or Sulla's pupils carp at
his proscription? But such was he who, while his fatal incest was in the doing, and
while his aiace was spawning her abortione, restored tha bitterest luws against adultery.
