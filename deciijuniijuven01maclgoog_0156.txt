SA'l'IRA VI. ’ 107

t
especially among women ι and these two were so mingled. that the very shrines which
cberished the one were the shameless soenes of the other. Extravaganee without
generosity, and driven on by mad lust, bred covetousness, and oovetousness murder, so
that poisonings were frequentanti notorious. 'l'be conditione of domestic slavery gave
· terrible scope for the caprices and violence which aelf-indulgence gcnerates3 and the ,„
sufferings of the poor wretches from the ill-temper of their mistreases is described in

language which has the air of anaveganee, but may neverthelees be accepted astrue, ’

not only from tbe testimony ofother writers, but hum the nature of the ease, the known
character of the women, the legal and social position of the slave, and moreover the
experiente (perhaps in more exceptione] cases) of modern times. 'l'be love of personal
display, of ilnery, of gossip, of public amusements‚ and tbe affectetion of learning, and
the pride of birth, and the aelf-complacency of virtue, are strongly put, but not more so
than the present generation might readily bear. Gluttony and drunkenncss are not
commonly reokoned among women's failings, bnt they appear to bave been prevalent in
the time of Domitian. 'l'hc folly which is perhaps most inexplicable, and without
parallel in our own days, was that of women of family engaging in the arena and
practising aa gladiatore, huntcra charioteers, and ao forth, in the Circus and Amphi·
theate. Tbat such was the madness of the time thero is no doubt ; and it forms one
of the many monstrons features of this satire, in which there are no traoes of those
crimes which are usually associated with the nobler passions in women, jealousy,
disappointed love, ambition; but all is gravelling, fllthy‚ depraved, and despicably
mean.

'fhc length of the poem and the eloseness of the style render tbe following argument
correspondingly long, and the nature of the language and'acenes nnavoidably introduced
in tbe satire, bnt not tlt to be reproduced, have made the argument defective But it
gives a pretty faithful idea of the contenta of the poem and its divisione. 'Ibe force of
the original can only be known by reading it,

The date of the satire has been fixed by some in Trajan's reign, or about an. 106.
The arguments are derived from tbe allusions to the Armenian king in v. 407, and to
, the way of dressingtho bair described in v. 501. There is an allusion in v. ³87 to the
Capitoline gamm said to bave been instituted by Domitian, from which it is inferred
that the poem could not bave been written before hia· reign, which the nature of it
would sufficiently show. Thoactes on the abovepassages may be consulted.
