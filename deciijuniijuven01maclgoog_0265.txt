SATIRA IX.

INTRODUCTION.

'Pars satire will not be read with any pleasure. lt is neverthclesa written with much
power. It ia a dialognrc between two acquaintances, one of whom has been making a
livelihood by the vilest services rendered to elleminate men. His friend expresses
surprise at his melancholy appearance, which hc explains by the scantiness os his weges
aad the hopelessnesa of his prospecta. The humour and severity of the entire oonaist in
the gravity of the man's complaints against Fortuna aad againw his lilthy employcr,
whom heupbraids with mcanness and reproachfnlly reminds of the great services hc had
rendered him, particularly in getting him children, which he was unable ιο get l'or himself.
'l'he &macter of injured innoeenee und nnrcquited iudustry which theman actsthrough·
ont, and the affected seriousness of the friend's symputhy aad counsel, are sufficiently
amusing. But the subject ia disgmting, and only the surpassing iniqnity of the age
could have justillcd the author ιο himself for devoting another satire to it. 1 have given
no argument. ’
