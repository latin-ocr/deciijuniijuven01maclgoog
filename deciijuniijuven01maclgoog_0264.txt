SATIRA VIII.

‚ · Exsulibus juvenes ipsius Consulis et quos
Magnum aliquid dubia pro libertate deceret,
Quod miraretur cum Coclite Mucius et quae
Imperii fines Tiberinum virgo natavit.

Matronis lugendus: at illos verbera justis
Adiciunt poenis et legum prima securis.
Malo pater tibi sit Thersites, dummodo tu sis
Aeacidae similis Vulcaniaque arma capessas, 270
Quam te Thersitae similem producat Achilles.
Et tamen, ut longe repetas longeque revolvas
Nomen, ab infami gentem deducis asylo.
Majorum primus quisquis fuit ille tuorum,
Aut pastor fuit aut illud quod dicere nolo. 275
