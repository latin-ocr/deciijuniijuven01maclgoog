SATIRA XIV. 339

Aestivum tona .” Infelix hnc forsitan ipsa 295
Nocte cadet fractis trabibus, fluctuque premetur
Obrutus et zonam laeva morsuque tenebit.
Sed cujus votis modo nou suffecerat aurum
Quod Tagus et rutila volvit Pactolus arena,
Frigida sufficient velantes inguina punni
Exiguusque cibus, mersa rate naufragus assem
Dum rogat et picta se tempestate tuetur.
Tantis parta malis cura majore metuque
Serventur. Misera est magni custodia census.
Dispositis praedives hamis vigilare cohortem Ἰ
Servorum noctu Licinus jubet, attonitus pro
Electro signisque suis Phrygiaque columna
Atque ebore et latu testudine. Dolia nudi
Non ardent Cynici : si fregeris, alteru fiet
Cras domus, aut eadem plumbo commissa manebit. ³10
