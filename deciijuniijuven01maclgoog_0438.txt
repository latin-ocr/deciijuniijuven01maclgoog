SATIRA II.

SATIRA II.

INTRODUCTION.

'lura Satira is nearly free from difficulty. It is addressed ιο one Macrinus on his birth·
dry, and Persius is led to coutrast tha prayers his friend, an honest man, will offer on
that day with those of the geueralityof men, who, while openly they appearto prayl‘or a
good understauding and u good report, inprivateaak forthegratificationcf their meanest
desires, sacrificing their floeks iu the hope the gods will increase them, and iu their in·
satuuted love of gold oderiug gold to the goda, and driving out the simplicity os theold
temple service, judging divine testes by those of human corruption. The moral is that ol
Horace's address ιο the rustic Phidyle, that he who brings to the altar clean hands and an
honest heart may oder the humblest sacrifice audit will be accepted

'lhe Satira may be read with pleasnre and some instruction. 'l'here is nothing forced or
unnatural in the lunguage. 'l'he illustratious are not numerous, and the connexion oi
the parts is easily followed. Above all, the lesson is not out of date, and aa long aa (iod
ond Mammon continue ιο be worshipped together, the impostura of hollow and selflsh
prayer will continue too. It is oue of the inconsisteucies of the human mind to acknow·
ledge the power of (iod by invoking it ιο the assistance of its own wickedness, which it
must be the flrst purpose os thet power, if it exista, ιο punish. It has becn said persever·
ingly by the commentatam and translatore, and Addison has laid it down rasa fact in the
Spectator, No. 207, that the ideas in this Satira are taken from the Dialogue falaely
ascribed toPlato, end called “Alcibiades Secundus.” I have looked through that spuri·
oua productior, and can sce no thought or traca of expression that Persius need be aup-
posed ιο have taken from that source ; and whether he ever read the Dialogus may be
doubtful. He had suggestion enough close at hand, in the book he studied most atten-
tirely-the men and women about him-to have enabled him ιο write aa much as he
pleased about hypocrisy, whether it took the form of prayer or any other; and every ἱ
time we imagine him borrowing from writers rather than from reul life, we degrada him
into a position he certainly does not deservo, that of an imitator and mere rhetorician.
This remark obviously does not apply ιο a case like that in S. iv.; where for the sake
of illustrat‘mg a general truth, which is the subject of the Satira, a scene ia taken
from Plato.

ARGUMENT.

Set down a white mark for this day, Macrinus, and pour libatiam ιο your Genius Yon ’

dc not need ιο take the goda apert aud buy their favour, as most of our great men
do; for ’tis not all can venture open prayer, banishing whispers from our temples.
'Ihey've common prayers for strangers' ears, but mutter to themselves—‘ Oh that
my uncle would depart this life? ‘Kmd Hercules, grant a treasure may turn np
beueeth my plough! ‘Would my wurd’s name were blotted from the will: he’s
scrofulous and bilious.’ ‘Nerius is burying his third wife! Το offer prayers like
these without offence you dip your head iu the 'liber twice or thrioe, und wash away
the night's dabarach.

V. 17. Now tell me-'tis not much-are you prepared ιο place Jove above-whom l—
why, Staius say, an uprigbt man as any. (ιο, ask ol Staius what you ask of Jove-
bow would he cry, ‘0 Jupiter ι’ aud shall not Jove cry out, ⁴0 Jupiter ι’
