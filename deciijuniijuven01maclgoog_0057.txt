D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Quid referam quanta siccum jecur ardeat ira, ⁴5
Quum populum gregibus comitum premit hic spoliator
Pupilli prostantis, et hic damnatus inani l
Judieio (quid euim salvis infamia nummis i)
Exsul ab octava Marius bibit et fruitur dis
Iratis; at tu, victrix provincia, ploras. εο

l Haec ego non credam Venusina digna lucerua?
