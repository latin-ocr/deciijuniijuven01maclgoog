· xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

temporarias, the personages on whom he pours out his indignation are
those with whom he aud his contemporaries were well acquainted, and
they are those of whom mention is made by Tacitus, Suetonius, the
younger Pliny, and Martial. In the spurious Satires, on the contrary,
which are the work of a Declamator, aa Ribbeck calls him, the few
trames which may belong to contemporaries of Juvenal are with some
exceptione totally unknown. These Satires also give us little informa·
tion on manners or· events in Rome, while nearly every line of the
genuine Satires contains instructius matter. The Declamator abounds
in allusione to Greek and Roman history aud to mythical legends.
Even Moses is introduced to us. It is true that the writer of the
genuine Satires shows that he was well ¹acquainted with Greek and
Roman history; but he handles his matter like a man of sense, who
knows the world, while the Declamator writes like a pedaut.

The Declamator, who tells us little about Rome, treats us with a great
deal about foreign parts, and in the fiftesnth Satira he even takes us
into Egypt3 and yet, as Ribbeck maintains, he does not even know that
Canopus (xv. 44, and the note) is in Egypt.

It has been observed also, he adds, that the Declametor has a turn for
philosophy, but the genuine Juvenal scarcely indicates any teste for such
speculatiou. He never uses the word Sapientia, which the Declamator
prizes highly, aud, following the Stoic doctrine, declares that Nature aud
Philosophy teach the something (xiii. 189). Η6 seems also to have
collected some of his philosophical matter from other writers; for
instance, Sat. x. 28, dcc, greatly resembles a passage in Seneca De
Tranquillitete Animi, c. 15, ‘Democritum potius ;' aud the matter of a
passage in Sat. x. 346 may have been derived from Valerius Maximus,
vii. 2, Ext. l (sea the note on that passage).

From this brief statement the reader may collect the nature of the

'ageneral objections to the genuineness of the five Satires which Ribbeck
attributes to an unknown Declamator. He supporta his general cou·'
clusion by an examination of many passages, and he employs a chapter
of three-and·seventy well filled peges in belabouring the unfortunate
Declamator, to whom, as far as I have observed, he shows no merit at
all, not even to the few lines which may be admired by those who do
not value all the Declamator's poetry. Those who will take the pains
to read Ribbeck’s satirical remarks on the false Satirist‚ will be amused
aud instructed, if they shall not be convinced. In fact he has under·
taken to prove what is often difficult to prove, and sometimes impossible;
to show fkom a comparison of writings, attributed to the same person,
that some are genuine and some are not. But he evidently has confi·
deuce iu his own conclusion, and he presses it so hard that he sometimes
misunderstauds or affecte not to understand that which others may find
