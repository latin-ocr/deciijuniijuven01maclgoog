nothing to recommend him. He has borrowed without 001000-

ledgment from Ruperti3 so at least that editor says. His remarks
V are very feeble. He has added in a separate volume notes more
valuable thau his own by the two brothers Valesii, written attha
end of the seventeenth century, but never before published entire.
He also had aocess to a large number 01 MSS. in the imperial
library at Paris. How he used them his references are 100 general
to enable the reader to judge. 'Phe only English edition 1 have bad
occasion to notice is one by Mr. Mayor (Cambridge, 1853), intended
for the nse of'schools5 the chief feature of which is alarge compila-
tion, from various sources, of references to other authors, classioal
and ecclesiastical, some given as quotations‚ but most by reference

to the places in which the passages are to be found. The object 01
this is said to be “to rescue certain authors from uudeserved oon·
tempt.” The authors meant are those later than the Augustan
age. Whether they are held in undeserved contempt, or whether
this commentury has ’helped to rescue them, Ι do not know. Mr.
Mayor does not approve of Heinrich, and from the nature of his
own commentary it was not to be expected that he would. His
text professes to be that of Jahn, “except in orthography and
punctuation.'¹ In his interpretation when he has 00 opportunity
he follows the judgment of Madvig, 10 whose Opusoula there are
two essays in which some passages 01 Juvenal are commented upon.
With all respect for that eminent scholar, 1 do not think the inter-
pretation of Juvenal was quite in his way. Ihave mentioned his
· opinion 10 several places. The names of Grangaeus, Britannicus,
Herminius, aud other scholar's of the sixteenth and serenteenth
centurias, will be found 10 these notes. 'l'heir commentarios, in
part or entire, are collected in a thick quarto volume, published at

, heyden by Herminius in 1695, which book Ruperti calls “ indi-

gestam vanae speciosaeque doctrinae farraginem, rudemque rerum
inutilium'molemf’ It contains much‘that is wrong and a great deal

that is' good, and Ruperti need not bave despised it. The edition of
Lubinus (Hanover, 1603) I have bad by me. Ruperti looks upon
him as ‘¹ verbosus nugator.” He was a learned man and the friend
of learned men, and often understood Juvenal where Ruperti did not.
