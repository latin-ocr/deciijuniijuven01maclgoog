LIFE OF JUVENAL. xix

would put his birth, at the earliest, in the third year of N ero, au. 56,
aud I am inclined to think that this is not far from the date. [Ribbeck
has come to the same conclusion, «Iuvenalis Sat. Praefatio] That he
was familiar with the iniquities of N ero does not certainly prove that
he lived in his reign, and according to the above supposition he was not
more than twelve when N ere died, perhaps less. Of Domitian he writes
with a contempt and loathing which seem to be the fruit of a personal
acquaintance with his times, and a memory full of disdain. That he
was of full age in Domitian's reign is certain, since he had formed an
intimate friendship with Martial before the seventh book of his Epigrams
was published That book was aritten an. 93, and contains two
epigrama, one alluding, and the other addressed, to Juvenal, in terme of
affectionate familiarity. This alone would be sufficient proof thatJuvenal
was not exiled by Domitian, at any rate tili after the above year, which
was ten years aster the death of Paris, and not three years before -
Domitiau’s. In Martial's twelith book there is an epigram (18) addressed ,
to Juvenal at Rome, Martini being at his native place, Bibilis in Spain. *g
This epigram was written between the years an. 100 αηάΛΙΟ4, not long Λ
aster the accession of Trajan, and it supposes Juvenal to be wandering
restlessly about the town aud tiring himself with attendance on great
people. If, therefore, any banishment took place in Domitiau’s time,
the cause could not have been that assigned by the Grammarians, and
it must have been of short duration„

Adopting then such data as appear to have any probability in them,
the following may be laid down as a sketch of Juvenal's life, without
pretending to accuracy, for which there are no materiale.

His name was Decius «Iunius Juvenalis.

He was born possibly at Aquinum, in Latium, about the beginning of
Nero’s reign, that is soon after Au). 54, of respectable parents, his
father being a rich libertinus, and he himself therefore ingenuus. He

received the usual education of a Roman bey aud youth, as he says (S.
i. lsi:

‘⁴ nt nos ergo manum ferulae subsistimus, at nos
Consilium dedimus Sullae privatus ut altum
Dormiret.''

He took the ‘toga virilis' about the beginning of Vespasiau's reign,
nn. 70, aud having, as he says above, learnt rhetoric in the schools, he
continued to practise itas a man, not professionally‚ but for his own
amusement, through the reign of Vespoeian and the greater part of
Domitiau’s, that is, till the ycar au. 94, in which year or the next he
by some means offended Domitian, aud was sent by him inte Egypt
’ with a military command, such as civilians often received during the
Empire. In an. 96 Domitian was killed aud Nerva succeedsd him.
