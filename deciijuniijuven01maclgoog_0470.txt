SATIRA V.

Hic Campo indulget; hunc alea decoquit3 ille
In Venerem est putris: sed cum lapidosa cheragra
Fregerit articulos veteris ramalia fagi,
Tunc crassos transisse dies lucemque palustrem . σο
Ει sibi jam seri vitam ingemuere relictam.
At te nocturnis juvat impallescere chartis,
Cultor enim juvenum purgatae inseris aures

Finem animo certum miserisque viatica canis. 65

Nam quamvis prope te, quamvis temone sub uno 70
Vertentem sese, frustra sectabere canthum,
Cum rota posterior curras et in axe secundo.
