⁹ Ι

ὖΰῧιῗγηοοτο much admired by the ancients⁵, and have been abun·

dantly quoted by Grammarians, by Fathsrs of the Church, and

mediasval writers. If certain passages are less familiar to modern ,

ears, than their fitness for quotation might lead us to expect, it is from
the difficulties of the poetry, which have deterred men of our day from
reading itas it deserves. The subject of the first Satire, which deals
with the vicious poetieal teste of the day, and has many quotations from,
or imitatione of, the verses of contemporary writers, would be more in·
teresting and intelligible when it was first published than it is to us,
and this Satira alone would create a large demand for the volume. The
Epistle to Macrinus comes mors home to ourselves as dealing with the
worship of God, the selfish or worldly abuse of which is common to all
ages. The introduction I have prefixed to the third Satira may per·
haps lead some to read it with curiosity, and they will not be disap-
pointed. The more I read it, the more I admira it. Seli-ignorance is
a large subject, which might be better handled than it is in the fourth
Satire3 and the folly of running after and hoarding money to be squan·
dered by one’s heirs is not ‘done as much justice to in the sixth as it
probably would have been if the poet had finished it. The fifth is
generally considered the best in the book, though I myself prefer the
third. In the fifth there is that tribute to the goodness of Cornutus
which proves the goodness of the writer and the gracefulness with which
he could write. It also shows more of the philosophical school in
which Persius had been trained, without however introducing any thing
more new than the Stolo doctrine that the only free man is the
sage, with which Cicero and Horace had⁸ before made their readers
familiar. There are more imitatione of Horace in this Satire than in ⁴
any other.

A writer of satire may be ‘ferus et ,violens’ with his pen, and yet
very amiable in manners, as the Grammarian describes Persius to have
been. He msy also in those days have been chaste and modest, aud yet
have used language for the exposure of vice which now munet be used,
or even read without discomfort. There is nothing in Persius’ style to
contmdict the pleasing description given of him by his biographer, which
probably was quite true. More than one gem now in existence has

⁴ J ul. Scaliger thought Persius wrote obscursly ou purpose that t'ools might admira
him. He is very severe on Persius. (See Scal. Post. vi. c. 6, iii. c. 97.)
⁸ Quintilian (x. 1. 94) says, “Multum et verae gloriae, quamvis uno libro, Persius
meruit? hlartial (iv. 29) says,
“Saepius iu libro numeratur Persius uno
Quam levis in tota Marsus Amazonide.”
