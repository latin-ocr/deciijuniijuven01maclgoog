says 3 the town is overrun with cunning foreigners und upstarts who heva tricked them·
sclves into riches and influence, making themselves necessary tofemilies end getting their
mneters’ secrets. The poor too heve uo chance, snd poverty apes weslth; every thing
hes to be bought, and every thing is deur. There ere lires end falling honsee, and even
these ere only ruinons to the poor: the rich help oue another, while tho poor 111111 starves.
The noises at night ere such thst no one cen slcep, st least uo poor men 111 the lodging·
houses. The rich men rides safely through the streete, while the poor 11 elbowed 1] the
crowd, end hns s good chance of being killed by great beams and stenes, or by pota from
the npper stories, and so forth, or 1] some drunken hrawler who picks a querrel with him,
or by robbers who break into his house nt night.

beeting his victim savngely, summons him for an 11111111.

bricius' resolution to quit the town and go ewey to the pleasant shores of Cnmse.
There is no wilderness I would not myself proferto the dengers end ennoysnces of

V. 21. ‘⁸ Noroom is here forvirtue, no return for honest lebour; sud nsI sm getting poorer
every day, I mean to take myself to Cumee while 1 heve any vigonr len. 1 hid my
native plece fnrewell; let rogues live there, and by their dirty trades get rich, till
trumpeters 111111 rise to give the shows they once procleimed, and get monopolies of
every thing, rsised high 1] fortune in her merry moods. What can ldo et Rome? not “
lie, or praise poor books, ortell the 11111, 01 search the insides of frogs. I am no pimp

V. 81. “What, must I not avoid their purple 1 shall that mun rank before me who neme

prsise a blockheed’s talenta, und n plain mnn's fece, long neck, end squeaking voice.
If 1 should preise them, no one would believe me. Their acthig isquite perfect ς their
